0,this is a multi part message in mime format picked text plain from multipart alternative agÃªncia de notÃ­cias da aids editoria pÃ¡g dia mÃªs ano escapenumber abril escapenumber for merck patients and the country lose with de declaration of public interest of efavirenz escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber Â– escapelong in an exclusive interview to agÃªncia de notÃ­cias da aids the corporative communication director of merck sharp dohme joÃ£o sanches affirmed that not only the pharmaceutical industry or merck lose with the declaration of public interest of efavirenz done by the ministry of health through the decree published in this wednesday escapenumber in the official union diary i think that everybody loses patients and the country as well said the executive he comments that the news was a surprise for the company because they were in the middle of a negotiation process with the brazilian government and reaffirmed the unequivocal commitment of merck to try to find a solution for aids however he highlights that to keep doing research is important to have a safe environment for investment and a return for the shareholders and for the people who are investing in this way read the full interview agÃªncia aids what is merck' position about the decree published today in the official diary declaring the public interest of efavirenz joÃ£o sanches it was a surprise for us because we are still in a process and we understand that we are in the middle of a negotiation process i donÂ´t have a lot to say because we are exactly in the middle of the process from our point of view we are sure and expect that the brazilian government does not issue the compulsory license because we do not believe that this is a solution neither for patients nor society and neither for the country nor for the pharmaceutical industry as a whole agÃªncia aids according to the decree one of the reasons for the government taking this action was the fact that no agreement was achieved with merck for the price the government proposal was the adoption of the price set in thailand of us escapenumber escapenumber and the merck' proposal was a discount of escapenumber of the current price which is us escapenumber escapenumber why such a small reduction why the industry is so intransigent in the negotiations joÃ£o sanches i think it is important to look at the historical process of this discussion in escapenumber we gave two discounts to the ministry a discount of escapenumber and right after because of a negotiation we gave an additional discount of escapenumber as we recognize that brazil is a country with an excellent treatment aids program and that give access to all patients because all our policy is corporate it is global and based on access as a result of these two discounts the efavirenz's price in brazil is the lowest in the world and is still currently the lowest all over the world for countries which have medium hdi human develoment index and prevalence lower than escapenumber which is the case of brazil that is classified in the global access policy established by merck together with other pharmaceutical companies and the united nations world health organization and world bank these criteria were not set by us it is a criteria of common agreement the second thing i can tell you is that the price of efavirenz in brazil since it was launched in escapenumber had a reduction of escapenumber so i think that when you ask me this question we are looking at a certain time isolating it from the historical fact efavirenz's price is today the lowest among the other anti retrovirals bought by the national std aids program escapenumber of the patients use stocrin brand name for efavirenz but it represents only escapenumber of the total cost of the program agÃªncia aids in an interview to the agÃªncia an activist said that pharmaceutical industry should be more transparent should show their real costs for medicines he said that if companies spent less money with marketing and publicity it would be possible to reduce the medicines prices and make it affordable for those who need why the industry does do that joÃ£o sanches i donÂ´t have any comment to make about this declaration because the figures of pharmaceutical companies such as merck are published and are public and the balance follows the parameters of sound accountancy what i think people usually forget for example is the commitment that we have had for escapenumber years to research innovative medicines and that the first anti retroviral comes from merck sharp dohme researches research is in the long term and we keeping researching vaccines until now we have two candidates in trials for a vaccine against hiv aids our commitment is to undoubtly find a solution for this disease but to keep doing this research it is important that we have a safety environment for investment and have a return for shareholders and for people that in any way are investing for that agÃªncia aids considering what aids represents today in the world don't you think that it is the moment for pharmaceutical companies have a different policy for aids medicines joÃ£o sanches do you know our global access policy it already does that i will summarize it for you the global access policy set together with world bank united nations organization unaids who and some pharmaceutical companies established two criterias hdi and prevalence of adult population among that there are three categories of countries the first one which usually are developed countries have high hdi and prevalence lower than escapenumber there is a second group where brazil is included which are countries with medium hdi and prevalence lower than escapenumber for adult population in this price range brazil has the lowest price and the third range which include all subsaarian african countries which have the low hdi and prevalence more than escapenumber why the prevalence because it means the cost for society and for health systems of these countries to treat hiv aids in the case of botswana escapenumber of the adult population are infected by hiv aids it is impossible to compare botswana and brazil where the prevalence of the lattest is of escapenumber escapenumber and the hdi are totally different so according to these categories we have a global price policy for example in countries with medium hdi and prevalence below escapenumber such as brazil efavirenz's price is us escapenumber escapenumber in brazil the price is us escapenumber escapenumber agÃªncia aids up to where does merck intend to go in the negotiation with the government so that it doesnÂ´t bear the burden of the responsibility for the issuance of a compulsory license joÃ£o sanches usually we understand that we are committed and will keep negotiating with the brazilian government we believe that the compulsory license is not the best solution now what i would like to contribute is that all this discussion is always looking from one side which is from the pharmaceutical industry it is not only pharmaceutical industry or merck those who lose i think everybody lose patients lose and the country also lose because Â– coming back to what i have said in the beginning Â– efavirenz is today the most economical solution among other medicines for the cocktail government has maurÃ­cio barreira free translation

0,on tue jun escapenumber escapenumber at escapenumber escapenumber escapenumberam escapenumber frank k ster wrote that's true as an ideal in reality you can't expect every dd or even maintainer to subscribe to legal except when they've got a particular problem to discuss escapenumber sure but you don't need or want that all you need is an unbiassed sampling of developers to participate which is to say the list needs to be just as open to extremist opinions from people who think the gfdl is completely free as people who think the gpl is actually non free afaics the only way that's going to happen is by taking the view that debian's definition of free as per the dfsg free is just one view you can take and that people who take alternative views whether stricter or more liberal whether focussed on legal details or ignorant of them in favour of just doing stuff are still worth listening to even though their views on what's free or not may well be fundamentally different to debian's if the only question is is this free or not then you're going to get turf wars because there's just no middle ground and whoever gets to make that decision controls the debate even just having analyses take the form of these are the consequences personally i'd avoid them though debian doesn't think the problem's a big enough deal to worry about don agrees with me but francesco doesn't seems like it'd be most of the way there but as it stands legal's analysis seems to me more to fit the mold of this is conceivably bad in some circumstances not the same as anything in any good licenses therefore it's non free and that's all there is to it i'm not sure however that this is the general attitude on legal i've never encountered it escapenumber take don and jordi g h 's exchange this month if you disagree with the determination of the developers you can easily install the work from non free or cease supporting debian in its entirety the choice is yours really escapenumber our way or the highway isn't a nice thought either do you really think that the dds that voted against putting the gfdl in non free should fork off too debian is the best distro out there and i'm very loyal to it but i'malso very unhappy with its treatement of the gfdl and i think this horrible mess should be fixed and no to be fair skimming the archives does indicate it's not the general attitude at all and i'm also pleased to have stumbled across an example of michael poole noting he's not a lawyer or dd while giving his thoughts advice equally if legal were working escapenumber how i wanted it to that'd just mean i'd be happy to trust it implicitly and wouldn't pay any attention to it at all which probably means that the times i do pay attention now are the times it's going imo severely wrong which is going to produce a pretty biassed view on my behalf comparing ted tso's and thomas bushnell's views as cited on lwn some time ago escapenumber is probably a good reference point too having disagreements like the current one over choice of venue be escalated into claims that are one set of dds are trying to prov e they are holier than stallman or another are sell ing out freedom isn't very helpful if we want the dfsg to be useful at helping upstreams and users in my opinion and ymmv etc analysing licenses so that we can say these are almost certainly the effects which barely anyone disagrees with gpl is viral cddl is viral and gpl incompatible qpl requires modifications to be made as patches these are things that might not happen but that you might be concerned at gfdl stuff can't be encrypted or even have unix permission bits set cddl leaves you vulnerable to nuisance suits in foreign countries these are ways you can avoid some of the drawbacks use mit instead of the old bsd license explicitly limit when choice of venue comes into play different people and organisations may reasonably have different views on the acceptability of various effects the fsf view the affero gpl and gfdl as free osi views the apsl as free and you may want to make a different choice to any or all of those organisations debian's choices are focussed on ensuring we can develop and distribute a high quality operating system that works for our users this may mean we'll accept some licenses that aren't as free as we'd like them to be in some cases such as licenses with patch clauses or obnoxious advertising clauses etc escapenumberrom what i've seen debian legal isn't very good at accepting anything less free than it'd like which is pretty understandable but not really helpful either in advocating debian's views which are more accepting or in working with other groups upstream or down who don't have the patience for endless nitpicking it could also be a lot better at summarising thoughts about what will and might happen for a given license we've discussed this years ago read the archives isn't a really good answer obviously if debian's going to say a license isn't free enough we should be able to explain very simply and without needing to be very hypothetical or theoretical how users developers distributors are going to be blocked escapenumberrom doing useful things that is what the bad effects are not just point at the bad clause or your right freedom that's being violated if the cddl is non free we ought to be able to come up with an explanation like if someone creates a new version of opensolaris don't assign their copyright to sun and you download and use it they can and thus prevent you from travelling to anywhere in the united states or canada without having to pay extortionate damages simply by the fact that you've downloaded and used their software that's sufficient to convince reasonable people not just people who've already signed onto the dfsg that they don't want to use non sun copyrighted versions of opensolaris sun versions of opensolaris are different in that aiui we have a sun rep or two on the record as indicating that circumstance isn't intended which should be sufficient to stop it actually happening if we decide our acceptance of the cddl relies on that assurance then we can add it to debian copyright for packages it covers and not distribute ones it doesn't cheers aj escapenumber http lwn net articles escapenumber

0,may escapenumber escapenumber salem massachusetts by timothy lutts the hungarian at the wedding invest in this credit card company for long term profits my favorite chinese solar power stock last weekend i attended a wedding here in salem the daughter of a friend married a young man from madrid and i was fortunate to meet a number of interesting young people chiefly recent graduates of johns hopkins and yale as well as a contingent from spain with the spaniards i didn't get beyond the usual wedding pleasantries no surprise given the language barrier on both sides with the young american graduates i did better most interesting were a couple of earnest young men trained in finance one landed a job with morgan stanley in london while the other is working at thomas h lee partners in boston bright young men without question and well trained in finding things to buy that will be worth more later but i got the sense that while both will succeed at their jobs at making money they have no purpose beyond that shades of the thoughts of kevin phillips found in my wealth advisory of may escapenumber with luck greater purpose will come with maturity by far the most interesting guest at the wedding came from neither the u s nor spain but from hungary his name is laszlo szekfu at escapenumber he's one of hungary's best known internet entrepreneurs he's also an adviser to the minister of economy and transport and he's using his networking skills to build a biotechnology cluster around a promising vaccine for hiv aids so why was he at the wedding for the past semester he's been a yale world fellow which means he's been paid to attend high level classes at yale while networking with escapenumber other world fellows as they work to increase global cooperation as well as stimulate progress in their own countries when this young man was born escapenumber years ago hungary was still controlled by communists and the future was bleak today it's a member of the european union still struggling with inflation and unemployment but expecting to adopt the euro by escapenumber if not by escapenumber and entrepreneurs like laszlo szekfu are part of the reason but what does this have to do with investing well at the very least it reminds me that it's a big world out there with a wide range of investment opportunities if you're limiting yourself to american blue chips you're missing out on a lot of the fun more specifically it reminds me that as communism falls by the wayside in various countries around the world younger generations who are not saddled by memories and habits learned in the old days are turning the underused assets of their countries to good use just as laszlo is in hungary holdouts to this trend are north korea and cuba but the clock is ticking and then there's china which nominally is still communist but practically speaking is determinedly capitalistic to me this feels like a new model and i think it's appropriate for a country in transition what comes next for china no one knows ideally a far more educated populace a representative democracy free elections and a higher standard of living though not necessarily in that order but regardless of whether communism eventually withers in china you can't ignore the fact that today china's economy is booming along at a escapenumber rate more or less the reliability of the figures is questionable and authorities are working hard to keep it from expanding faster workers are streaming from their farms into cities where jobs are multiplying rapidly and consumers are beginning to spend which brings me to my first stock mastercard mastercard of course is a well known name it's one of the top two credit card companies in the world but it's no dinosaur it's taking full advantage of the globalization movement to leverage its brand and the results are apparent in the company's first quarter results which revealed a escapenumber increase in transactions over last year a escapenumber increase in revenues and a escapenumber increase in earnings those results touched of a wave of new buying a few weeks ago which earned the stock a place in cabot top ten report and here's what we said mastercard is a global brand and a very profitable one it provides services in more than escapenumber countries serving over escapenumber escapenumber financial institutions yet its business is not well understood by most consumers mastercard does not issue credit cards or set interest rates or annual fees on cards or solicit merchants to use cards but it serves as a liaison between financial institutions and merchants and the businesses and customers that use its cards taking a tiny fee for every payment processed and working hard to keep the system secure it even acts as an advisor to all those parties using its data mining capabilities to tell its partners how they can derive maximum benefit from the service mastercard's is a well established robust business with limited competition and it's only getting better two factors we like in particular in recent quarters revenue growth has been accelerating and in the latest quarter the profit margin hit a plum escapenumber escapenumber the best in years if not ever fundamentally we also like the stock because it's only been public for one year so there are far more potential buyers especially among institutions than sellers looking deeper into the business i see that mastercard has been offering services in china since escapenumber and that its greatest growth in the first quarter came from china india and brazil looking forward i expect more of the same so i recommend the stock as a long term holding advertisement our next escapenumber stocks could put you on easy street cabot top ten

in their early stages stocks like hansen natural titanium metals and ultra petroleum to get started with a no risk trial subscription simply click the link below http cabotmail net t escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber now some of you are going to look at this stock and say mastercard is trading for escapenumber a share i can't afford that give me something that's under escapenumber and i understand where you're coming from you think you have a better chance of making money in a stock that's selling for under escapenumber than you do of making money in a stock that's selling for escapenumber but with all due respect you're wrong sure the low priced stock has the potential to make you money faster but it also has the potential to take your money away faster more importantly it is more likely to take your money away at bottom it's a matter of quality the escapenumber stock which is in an uptrend is supported by a growing number of institutions and by improving perceptions not to mention excellent fundamentals but most stocks selling under escapenumber got there by falling from above escapenumber and that alone tells you something went wrong furthermore it suggests there are shareholders still waiting to sell until the stock climbs back to their buy price so they get out even and it tells you there will precious few institutional shareholders to provide stability for the stock consider for example three names from our past going back as far as ten years when we and many other investors thought hydrogen fuel cells were the next big thing there was ballard power bldp which had partnered with daimler and ford to provide fuel cells for cars and there were fuel cell energy fcel and plug power plug who were working on fuel cells for stationary applications have you seen any fuel cell powered cars lately no you see toyota priuses and houses powered by hydrogen it's not happening in every case the hopes and dreams of both management and investors have failed to come true as a result all three stocks are trading in the single digits bldp is escapenumber fcel is escapenumber and plug is escapenumber and commissions in the old days it may have mattered but in the internet era it doesn't you can spend escapenumber buying one share of mastercard assuming a escapenumber commission or you can spend it buying escapenumber shares of plug power i think your chances are better with one share of mastercard the symbol is ma and now that we're on energy i can segue into a hot little energy stock with great growth potential the background china gets escapenumber of its energy from coal it burns escapenumber escapenumber billion tons of coal per year more than the u s e u and japan combined and this coal pollutes its air which causes health problems so there's a great demand for clean energy solutions in china and globally there's growing demand due to increased perceptions of global warming for energy sources that replace the burning of fossil fuels i've mentioned solar power companies before and will likely mention them again i think this is a big growth market and i like the rapid growth these companies are experiencing today so today's topic is trina solar which stands out from the crowd because it's the one company in the industry that's vertically integrated here's what paul goodwin editor of cabot china emerging markets report wrote last month trina is working toward reducing the cost of solar cells in a number of innovative ways first trina's proprietary formulas allow it to use scrap silicon that has been discarded by other electronics and solar manufacturers back in escapenumber when the solar industry used just escapenumber of the world's silicon this wasn't so important but solar has now surpassed semiconductors as a silicon consumer and the global shortage of polysilicon feedstock has put pressure on all users since it takes escapenumber to escapenumber months to get a polysilicon plant up and running trina's ability to use scrap is a major advantage trina's second big advantage it's on the verge of becoming a totally vertically integrated manufacturer meaning that the company will soon refine its own silicon feedstock grow its own ingots cut its own wafers manufacture its own cells assemble its own modules and install its own systems all at its fab site in changzhou trina's third advantage is a little paradoxical it's that trina is both a young company but also already a major player in the industry with long term technology partnerships with companies in switzerland italy and germany trina's ingot production facility became fully operational just in october escapenumber and wafer manufacturing began just in february escapenumber by the end of escapenumber the company had reached escapenumber megawatts mw of production output output capacity is projected to reach escapenumbermw by the end of escapenumber yet despite this relative youth trina has sales in germany spain italy norway and australia in addition to its leadership in sales and research into solar homes and industrial installations in china there is no doubt that the generous subsidies offered by the german government have had a huge effect on global solar production but additional programs in california and renewed global interest in pv electricity production are creating a wave of new customers trina's revenues grew escapenumber in the first quarter to escapenumber escapenumber million while earnings grew escapenumber to escapenumber escapenumber per share and i'm confident there's plenty more growth ahead finally here's the timely part tsl peaked at escapenumber in mid april and then like all solar stocks pulled back toward its escapenumber day moving average in short the solar stocks needed a rest from the heated environment that followed their market leading first quarter performance as i write tsl sits right on that escapenumber day moving average at escapenumber and i think

escapenumber gmt from nathaniel grey however what i really want to know is how well my nueral net is doing at classifying my binary output variable i am new to r and i can't figure out how you can assess the success rates of predictions i've been recently tacking this myself though with respect to polytomous escapenumber outcomes the following approaches are based on menard escapenumber cohen et al escapenumber and manning schÃ¼tze escapenumber first you have to decide what is the critical probability that you use to classify the cases into class a and consequently not class a the simplest level is escapenumber escapenumber but other levels might also be motivated see e g cohen et al escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber you can then treat the classification task as two distinct types namely classification and prediction models which have an effect on how the efficiency and accuracy of prediction is exactly measured menard escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber in a pure prediction model we set no a priori expectation or constraint on the overall frequencies of the predicted classes to the contrary in a classification model our expectation is that the predicted outcome classes on the long run will end up having the same proportions as are evident in the training data as the starting point for evaluating prediction efficiency is to compile a escapelong prediction classification table frequency counts on the decending diagonal in the table indicate correctly predicted and classified cases whereas all counts off the diagonal are incorrect for the two alternatives overerall we can divide the predicted classifications into the four types presented below on which the basic measures of prediction efficiency are based manning and schÃ¼tze escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber original predicted class not class other class tp true positive fn false negative not class other fp false positive tn true negative you can then go on to calculate recall and precision or spesificity or sensitivity recall is the proportion of original occurrences of some particular class for which the prediction is correct formula escapenumber below see manning and schÃ¼tze escapenumber escapenumber formula escapenumber escapenumber whereas precision is the proportion of the all the predictions of some particular class which turn out to be correct formula escapenumber below see manning and schÃ¼tze escapenumber escapenumber formula escapenumber escapenumber sensitivity is in fact exactly equal to recall whereas specificity is understood as the proportion of non cases correctly predicted or classified as non cases i e rejected formula escapenumber below furthermore there is a third pair of evaluation measures that one could also calculate namely accuracy and error formula escapenumber below manning and schÃ¼tze escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber recall tp tp fn sensitivity escapenumber precision tp tp fp escapenumber specificity tn tn fn escapenumber accuracy tp tn n diag n k k however as has been noted in some earlier responses these aforementioned general measures do not in any way take into consideration whether prediction and classification according to a model with the help of explanatory variables performs any better than knowing the overall proportions of the outcome classes for this purpose the asymmetric summary measures of association based on proportionate reduction of error pre are good candidates for evaluating prediction accuracy where we expect that the prediction or classification process on the basis of the models should exceed some baselines or thresholds however one cannot use the goodman kruskal lambda and tau as such but make some adjustments to account for the possibility of incorrect prediction with this approach one compares prediction classification errors with the model error model to the baseline level of prediction classification errors without the error model baseline according to formula escapenumber below menard escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber the formula for the error with the model remains the same irrespective of whether we are evaluating prediction or classification accuracy presented in escapenumber but the errors without the model vary according to the intended objective presented in escapenumber and escapenumber subsequently the measure for the proportionate reduction of prediction error is presented in escapenumber below and being analogous to the goodman kruskal lambda it is designated as lambda prediction similarly the measure for proportionate reduction of classification error is presented in escapenumber and being analogous with the goodman kruskal tau it is likewise designated as tau classification for both measures positive values indicate better than baseline classification while negative values worse performance escapenumber error model n sum k escapenumber k n k k n sum diag n where n is the

0,this thread discussed r memory limitations compared handling with s and sas since i routinely use r to process multi gigababyte sets on computers with sometimes escapenumbermb of memory here are some comments on that most memory limitations vanish if r is used with any relational database my personal preference is sqlite rsqlite packaga because of speed and no admin used in embedded mode the comments below apply to any relational database unless otherwise stated most people appear to think about database tables as dataframes that is to store and load the whole dataframe in one go probably because appropriate function names are suggesting this approach also it is a natural mapping this is convenient if the data set can fit fully in memory but limits the size of the data set the same way as without using the database however using sql language directly one can expand the size of the data set r is capable of operating on we just have to stop treating database tables as 'atomic' for example assume we have a set of several million patients and want to analyze some specific subset the following sql statement select from patients where gender 'm and age between escapenumber and escapenumber will result in bringing to r much smaller dataframe than selection of the whole table also such subset selection may take less time then selecting from the total dataframe assuming the table is properly indexed also direct sql statements can be used to pre compute some characteristics internally in the database and bring only the summudles to r select avg age from patients group by gender will bring a data frame of two rows only admittedly if the data set is really large and we cannot operate on its subsets the above does not help though i do not believe that this would the the majority of the situations naturally going for a escapenumberbit system with enough memory will solve some problems without using the database but not all of them relational databases can be very efficient at selecting subsets as they do not have to do linear scans when the tables are indexed while r has to do a linear scan every time i did not look up the source code of r please correct me if i am wrong two other areas where a database is better than r especially for large data sets verification of data correctness for individual points a frequent problem with large data sets combining data from several different types of tables into one dataframe in summary using sql from r allows to process extremely large data sets in a limited memory sometimes even faster then if we had a large memory and kept our data set fully in it relational database perfectly complements r capabilities r help stat math ethz ch mailing list https stat ethz ch mailman listinfo r help please do read the posting guide http www r project org posting guide html and provide commented minimal self contained reproducible code

0,this week on the perl escapenumber mailing lists developers shouldn't live in fear of o jerry gay in 'use of english pragma ' language second perl escapenumber microgrant phil crow on java to perl escapenumber declaration converter leon brocard announced that the second perl escapenumber microgrant had been awarded to phil crow for his proposal to convert java declarations to perl escapenumber more information about his proposal can be found in the grant application text details about the microgrant application procedure are available for those interested in submitting a proposal sescapenumber typo jonathan lang submitted a patch which corrects a typo in sescapenumber sescapenumber range semantics jonathan lang suggested a change to sescapenumber which was inspired by the new array indexing syntax from sescapenumber this would make ranges in an array index a natural outgrowth of the standard range semantics sescapenumber negation metaoperator jonathan lang had a proposal to generalize the negated relational operators to apply to any infix operator which returns a boolean larry wall rejected the suggestion because the relationals jonathan named are typed to return any not bool parrot porters perl escapenumber patch make disassemble useful kevin tew created ticket perl escapenumber with a patch and requested feedback back in july of escapenumber paul cochrane applied it as rescapenumber on april escapenumberst perl escapenumber bug failures in escapenumber tests during 'make test' partially patched james keenan created ticket perl escapenumber to report errors on escapenumber different tests later he closed the ticket because the failing tests were identified as part of ongoing work and the tests were no longer failing perl escapenumber cage run parrot under coverity prevent paul cochrane wanted to get coverity to run prevent on parrot this was ticket perl escapenumber more recently paul reported that he'd received a reply stating that parrot could certainly be added but that no date estimate was available at the moment syntax for constructing new objects and classes this thread began with klaas jan stol asking about the syntax for constructing new objects because he thought that it was going to be changed allison randal replied with examples of the two proposals for the new syntax this led alek storm to ask if new would be a vtable method or a pccmethod jonathan worthington confirmed that it is a pccmethod allison elaborated that it is a class method more recently alek replied that he thought that new should be kept an opcode and new should be a vtable method which is called from inside the new opcode jonathan worthington was confused by alek's proposal he suggested making baseclass implement all the vtable variants of a method and class can inherit from it and provide a sane interface alek thought that jonathan's suggestion was similar to one he had made in perl escapenumber but that jonathan's explanation was superior allison also added her thoughts to this subthread in the main thread jonathan proposed deprecating the old syntax in the next release and removing support for it in the following release allison agreed to marking it as deprecated now joshua isom wanted the dot syntax to still work so that tests wouldn't need to be rewritten allison explained that there were several reasons to remove constants for types and the class registry compilers pirc continued klaas jan stol added a vtable to the parser in compilers pirc he proposed looking at the bcg project to see if it would fit in with compilers pirc allison randal thought it was worth exploring svn parrot pdd rescapenumber trunk docs pdds draft a commit by allison randal integrated some questions and comments into the objects pdd jonathan worthington had a few comments such as noting that resolve is sugar rather than something new and that comments about offsets should go away allison noted that resolve is the preferred way of dealing with conflict resolution and removed references to offsets perl escapenumber extensive failures in t compilers imcc imcpasm t and t pmc sub t james keenan posted some failures in make test in ticket perl escapenumber paul cochrane reported that he was unable to replicate the failures with rescapenumber and asked james to check his revision james looked into it further and concluded that the name of the sandbox was affecting the test results he wondered if anyone could explain why that was happening svn parrot pdd rescapenumber trunk docs pdds a commit by paul cochrane noted that perl code with end or data blocks should not get an emacs or vim coda shawn m moore suggested putting the coda at the top of the file but paul explained that this had been attempted but proved to be a poor solution for several reasons perl escapenumber cage work out how to encourage good editor independent formatting habits paul cochrane created ticket perl escapenumber with the mission figure out how to encourage good formatting habits without assuming that everyone uses emacs or vim and with minimal clutter in our source code also write a coding standards test to codify this perl escapenumber cage generated files with timezoneless times in ticket perl escapenumber will coleda wanted tools which insert messages into generated files to include a timezone which should always be utc paul cochrane said that generated files are checked for timestamps in codingstd gmt utc t and that config init defaults pm was updated in rescapenumber to pass the test perl escapenumber cage add a perl critic policy to look for fixme todo xxx in ticket perl escapenumber paul cochrane suggested adding a check for 'fixme' 'todo' etc for the perl source files as there is currently only a check for the c files this was done in rescapenumber chris dolan suggested using an existing perl critic policy will coleda asked if andy lester would accept a patch which would optionally permit 'todo' comments which included ticket numbers and reject those which don't include ticket numbers andy replied that he didn't want to build exceptions and proposed that people just write 'rt escapenumber' instead of 'todo escapenumber ' paul cochrane agreed with this suggestion link'n'load on windows ron blaschke reported that he was looking into errors in linking and loading on windows with linking there were some symbols which weren't exported he planned to provide a patch to export them to solve the loading issue he wanted to change several files to include the full path current state of building parrot on cygwin ron blaschke reminded the list that it is necessary to include the absolute path to blib lib in the path environment variable to build on cygwin he also explained that some problems could be due to a file having windows line endings eric hanchrow wondered if it was possible to make parrot less fussy about the line endings ron wanted to see that happen but explained that his suggestions were workarounds until the problem was resolved steve peters said he would be looking at how to improve the process ron described his thoughts in more detail in 'link'n'load on windows ' chromatic asked if it was possible to pass flags to the linker to hint at the path which is how the linux version works ron thought that was handy but hadn't seen something similar for windows perl escapenumber patch configure pl refactor options processing functionality in ticket perl escapenumber james keenan posted a patch which removes command line option processing from configure pl and puts it in a library this was done to make testing easier the patch was applied as rescapenumber and escapenumber perl escapenumber patch borland c cleanups in ticket perl escapenumber steve peters submitted a patch which cleans up parrot for borland c on windows this patch does not completely solve compilation issues because it seems to create new issues on linux chromatic applied it as rescapenumber hash iteration question jonathan worthington showed two examples of iterating through a hash and noted that in his first example you will only get the first key in the hash he believes that the hash and iterator code are closely tied and isn't thread safe allison randal replied that the significant differences are down to the iterator's shift pmc throwing an exception if the key is escapenumber while shift string doesn't check she agreed that the code was excessively mixed and needed review leopold toetsch added a further explanation on the implementation pddescapenumber newclass jonathan worthington had a comment on pdd escapenumber and how it described the creation of a new class he wondered about the implementation allison randal replied that the newclass opcode will be a simple opcode jonathan implemented what allison described and created a test for it as well perl escapenumber bug pmcescapenumberc pl does anyone know how to use the 'no body' option in ticket perl escapenumber james keenan noted that nobody had spoken up in favor of retaining the no body option he said that he would take the ticket and assign the revisions to participants of the perl seminar phalanx phoneix project in ny perl escapenumber patch parrot cleanups part escapenumber steve peters submitted a patch in ticket perl escapenumber which had some cleanups to make parrot work better with different c compilers it was applied as rescapenumber paper on software patterns in parrot klaas jan stol mentioned that he had recently taken a course on software patterns and co authored a paper on patterns in parrot which he put on the wiki perl escapenumber cage parrot pmcescapenumberc pccmethod constants should be autogenerated jerry gay noted that lib parrot pmcescapenumberc pccmethod pm contains a number of constants which should be generated during the configure process and included ticket perl escapenumber discusses this request perl escapenumber todo mmd needs to be in a pdd jonathan worthington wanted multi method dispatch to be documented in one of the pdds or get its own pdd the request was made in ticket perl escapenumber perl escapenumber todo modify pccmethod syntax to more closely match pddescapenumber in ticket perl escapenumber jerry gay requested that the pccmethod syntax be modified to put it in line with pdd escapenumber chromatic offered a patch svn ci nci methods now name mangled jonathan worthington explained that he was starting to move class functionality into vtable methods but ran into the issue that you cannot have a method or pccmethod with the same name as a vtable method this is however required to implement the interface specified in pdd escapenumber he made some changes to get parrot working again which affected the complex pmc fran cescapenumber aescapenumberois perrad reported that this change breaks lua allison ran dal observed the same thing and asked jonathan to either fix the problem for lua or revert the change from the trunk jonathan apologized for breaking things and said that it was fixed in rescapenumber leopold toetsch suggested that perhaps language maintainers who are using features of parrot could submit core tests for these features so that this type of problem won't occur in the future joshua isom thought this could be expanded to anyone using parrot where a feature isn't tested he proposed an open repository for tests chromatic wondered if it was that difficult to mail in patches joshua offered some arguments in favor of it chromatic parrotcode updates will coleda solicited for suggestions concerning parrotcode org because the current system requires that he do quite a bit of work every time that directories are moved or files are added he proposed having a directory on the site which is a checked in version of the docs html directory after a make html he also suggested having docs for the latest release as well as for the 'svn head' perl escapenumber t doc pod t vs tools doc pod errors pl in ticket perl escapenumber will coleda suggested removing the script tools doc pod errors pl because the functionality is already replicated in t doc pod t also the script finds errors which the test does not which requires investigation joshua isom reported that he got a segmentation fault when he tried to run the script when he persisted with running it he found that it appeared to have a stricter pod checker jerry gay thought that perhaps the script and the test were checking different files paul cochrane found that on gentoo the t codingstd c indent t test caused perl to segfault but with a new perl compilation it worked he was curious because he wondered if the error was due to gentoo perl joshua replied that he was using darwin paul also remarked that the script reported where the errors were in the file which the test didn't do jerry gay and nicholas clark commented on this fwd yapc europe call for hackathons james e keenan reposted a call for hackathons which was published for yapc europe escapenumber he felt that the chicago hackathon had been good for parrot and hoped that someone would lead a related hackathon at y e more information about the offer can be found on the y e website re perl escapenumber autoreply p symbolic register allocation bug yehoshua sapir remarked that the code in perl escapenumber worked on os x perl escapenumber patch t pmc sub t test for creation of lex by clone op yehoshua sapir submitted ticket perl escapenumber which contains a patch to test the creation of lex by the clone op perl escapenumber patch configure pl move stdout messages to parrot configure messages james keenan created ticket perl escapenumber to submit a patch which makes lib parrot configure messages pm output messages to stdout previously this was done by configure pl this will make testing easier it was applied as rescapenumber svn parrot pdd rescapenumber in trunk docs pdds docs pdds draft allison randal made a commit which moved pdd escapenumber objects out of the draft directory use of english pragma james e keenan noted that configure pl uses one of the english variables namely output autoflush he wondered if there was a policy regarding the use of the named variables instead of their short versions jerry gay felt that it was wrong to use the english variables james said he would convert the variable while refactoring he created ticket perl escapenumber to remind him of this task later this was done and applied as rescapenumber svn ci pmc documentation guidelines draft jerry gay remarked that he had committed a draft of pmc documentation guidelines in rescapenumber the document is meant to explain the style of documentation which should be used for core pmcs klaas jan stol had some additions borrowed from 'perl best practices' joshua isom questioned klaas jan on some of the points and klaas jan elaborated perl escapenumber src pmc os pmc bad use of stat escapenumber and lstat escapenumber in ticket perl escapenumber the output of t pmc os t which fails on solaris escapenumber was attached perl escapenumber improper casting to void in src dynext c ticket perl escapenumber contained a small patch to change load func from a void pointer to null leopold toetsch explained that the cast was being used nicholas clark answered that the casting isn't allowed under strict ansi c but that he preferred assigning a plain escapenumber rather than a null perl escapenumber bug memory leak with string pmc mehmet yavuz selim soyturk reported a memory leak in some example code this was mentioned in ticket perl escapenumber vtable cleanup and questions jonathan worthington reported that he is adding the new vtable entries required for pdd escapenumber he wanted to know if become parent could be removed or if it needed a standard deprecation cycle he also noted that the subclass vtable method needed to be removed but that it was in use by parrotclass and parrotobject jonathan also noticed pmc new singleton and pmc get anonymous subclass which don't appear to be used he wondered if they should be removed finally he wanted to know if get attr and set attr should be deprecated nicholas clark confirmed that become parent isn't used anywhere will coleda voted for a standard deprecation cycle allison randal confirmed this she also agreed that the subclass vtable method won't be needed in the future and that get attr and set attr could be deprecated when the full change to pdd escapenumber is complete new singleton and get anonymous subclass were described as a case of being overly prepared for possible future needs minor notes suggestions on pddescapenumber klaas jan stol had some suggestions for pdd escapenumber he had some suggestions for improving consistency additional comments were on opportunities for syntactic sugar and a proposal that operators such as find method have the option of throwing an exception rather than returning a null pmc on failure allison randal remarked that the exception question was under consideration in i o as well and that the consistency issue would be considered when she looked at the opcodes pdd joshua isom had

action committee contributions have gone to republicans according to politicalmoneyline a nonpartisan company that tracks campaign donations lilly is a major donor making more than escapenumber escapenumber in contributions during the escapenumber election cycle the fourth highest among corporate health care pacs according to politicalmoneyline an early shift in contributions to favor the party in power is not uncommon and lilly expects to end up giving more to republicans than to democrats when contributions for the full two year election cycle for escapenumber are in said joe kelley lilly's vice president of government affairs but he said there are some changes that we made to recognize and be realistic about the fact that you've got a new group that are in town that are running things leahy now heads the senate committee that is rewriting patent laws which protect lilly's research and development work capital on capitol hill pharmaceutical industry critics long have argued that heavy spending on lobbyists and campaign contributions is a big reason lilly and other drug companies have gotten much of what they've sought in congress in recent years that reputation will be put to the test this year under a busy agenda caused in part by the democratic takeover of congress several pending issues could affect the bottom line of one of indiana's most important companies while also reducing drug prices for consumers the early scorecard is mixed lilly has won some battles as efforts failed to allow drug importation and require the government to negotiate with the industry for lower medicare drug prices but it lost when the government revised pending trade agreements to go further in enabling generic competition in developing countries and a proposal that would open up biological drugs to generic competition has a good chance of becoming law such drugs which represented escapenumber percent of lilly's sales last year are exempt from competition that's allowed with traditional chemical compounds such as prozac heavy lobbying the pharmaceutical and health products industry has spent more on lobbying washington escapenumber escapenumber billion since escapenumber than any other industry according to the center for responsive politics the intense lobbying represents the rising role prescription drugs are playing in health care as well as their rising cost for almost escapenumber years they've been among america's most profitable industries said bill vaughn senior policy analyst for health at the consumers union the escapenumber escapenumber million lilly reported spending on lobbying last year was the escapenumberth highest amount reported by the dozens of companies trade associations and advocacy groups related to the industry lilly won't have to report on its lobbying spending for this year until august but lilly has escapenumber lobbyists in its stable and three new outside firms have already registered to lobby for the company it's the busiest i've ever seen it jay bonitt lilly's director of government affairs said of the activity on capitol hill this year lilly recently hired alex m azar ii former deputy secretary of health and human services to oversee federal and state governmental affairs teams among his duties full agenda lilly and other companies are on full alert this year mostly because of timing and the democratic takeover of congress the law that requires drug companies to pay fees to the food and drug administration to expedite the agency's review of new medicines is up for renewal and is attracting other measures including new drug safety requirements democrats reopened pending trade deals in part to cut some patent protections for brand name drug firms public health groups say such protections keep cheaper medicines out of developing countries public health groups have complained for years that the government advisory committees created to help negotiate deals are full of industry representatives and exclude public health groups president bush recently appointed sidney taurel lilly's chief executive to the senior trade advisory panel u s rep henry waxman d calif the main house sponsor of the generic biological drug legislation that the industry opposes said drug companies might not be as successful on this issue as they've been on others i think it's a different situation now waxman said lilly acknowledges that some form of legislation allowing generic biological drugs eventually will pass but the company will continue to use its lobbying muscle to make arguments it hopes will resonate with lawmakers at the end of the day you have to understand how some of this works most of the states have a life sciences initiative going on kelley said they're

directly escapenumber yes this is my work email i will summarize named or anonymous as escapenumber contributers desire to the list escapenumber i'm founding member of an r competence center at an international escapenumber consulting company delivering r services mainly to the financial and pharmaceutical industries unit testing is escapenumber central to our development methodology and we've been systematically using runit with great satisfaction escapenumber mainly because of its simplicity the presentation of test reports is basic though experiences concerning escapenumber interaction with the runit developers are very positive gentle and responsive people we've never used butler i think it is not actively developed even if escapenumber the developer is very active it should be said that many of our developers including myself have escapenumber backgrounds in statistics more than in cs or software engineering and are not always acquainted with the escapenumber functionality in other unit testing frameworks and the way they integrate in ides as is common in these other languages i'll soon be personally working with a junit guru and will take the escapenumber opportunity to benchmark runit ess emacs against his toolkit eclipse with junit and other plugins working in perfect escapenumber harmony' his words even if in my opinion the philosophy of test driven development is much more important than the escapenumber tools used it is useful to question them from time to time and your message reminded me of this i'll keep you escapenumber posted if it interests you why not work out an evaluation grid check list for unit testing frameworks totally unrelated to the former it might be interesting to ask oneself escapenumber how ess could be extended to ease unit

escapenumberd escapenumberd from tony plate hi i've been looking at testing frameworks for r too so i'm interested escapenumber to hear of your experiences perspective here's my own experiences perspective the requirements are escapenumber it should be very easy to construct and maintain tests escapenumber it should be easy to run tests both automatically and manually escapenumber it should be simple to look at test results and know what went wrong escapenumber where i've been using a homegrown testing framework for s plus that is loosely escapenumber based on the r transcript style tests run r and compare output with escapenumber rout save in 'tests' dir there are two differences between this escapenumber test framework and the standard r one escapenumber the output to match and the input commands are generated from an escapenumber annotated transcript annotations can switch some tests in or out escapenumber depending on the version used escapenumber annotations can include text substitutions regular expression escapenumber style to be made on the output before attempting to match this helps escapenumber make it easier to construct tests that will match across different escapenumber versions that might have minor cosmetic differences in how output is escapenumber formatted we use this test framework for both unit style tests and system testing escapenumber where multiple libraries interact and also call the database one very nice aspect of this framework is that it is easy to construct escapenumber tests just cut and paste from a command window many tests can be escapenumber generated very quickly this way my impression is that is is much much escapenumber faster to build tests by cutting and pasting transcripts from a command escapenumber window than it is to build tests that use functions like all equal to escapenumber compare data structures it is also easy to maintain tests in the face escapenumber of change e g with a new version of s plus or with bug fixes to escapenumber functions or with changed database contents i use ediff in emacs to escapenumber compare test output with the stored annotated transcript and can usually escapenumber just use ediff commands to update the transcript this has worked well for us and now we are looking at porting some code escapenumber to r i've not seen anything that offers these conveniences in r it wouldn't be too difficult to add these features to the built in r escapenumber testing framework but i've not had success in getting anyone in r core escapenumber to listen to even consider changes so i've not pursued that route after escapenumber an initial offer of some simple patches to tests mk and wintests mk runit doesn't have transcript style tests but it wasn't very difficult escapenumber to add support for transcript style tests to it i'll probably go ahead escapenumber and use some version of that for our porting project and offer it to escapenumber the community if the runit maintainers want to incorporate it i also escapenumber like the idea that runit has some code analysis tools that might escapenumber support some future project that allowed one to catalogue the number of escapenumber times each code path through a function was exercised by the tests i just looked at 'butler' and it looks very much like runit to me and escapenumber i didn't see any overview that explained differences do you know of escapenumber any differences cheers tony plate escapenumberd escapenumberd escapenumberd escapenumberd escapenumberd escapenumberd escapenumberd escapenumberd

testing frameworks i've started looking at both butler and escapenumber runit i would be grateful to receieve real world development escapenumber experience and opinions with either both please send to me directly escapenumber yes this is my work email i will summarize named or anonymous as escapenumber contributers desire to the list i've been using runit and have been quite happy with it i had not heard of butler until i read your mail runit behaves reasonably similarly to other unit frameworks and this made it easy to get started with as i have used both junit and pyunit unittest module two things to be wary of escapenumber at last check you cannot create classes in unit test code and this makes it difficult to test some types of functionality i'm really not sure to what extent this is runit's fault as opposed to limitation of the sescapenumber implemenation in r escapenumber they have chosen a non default rng but recent versions provide a way to override this this provided for some difficult bug hunting when unit tests behaved differently than hand run code even with set seed the maintainer has been receptive to feedback and patches you can look at the not so beautiful scripts and such we are using if you look at inst unittest in category gostats biobase graph best wishes seth escapenumberd escapenumberd escapenumberd escapenumberd escapenumberd escapenumberd

one escapenumber piece that i found missing in my version was some form of gui based escapenumber tester i e push a button and test but i think i've not thought through escapenumber some of the issues

0,dear list members i use both r and matlab and find that each has its own strengths matlab definitely has the edge when it comes to the interactivity of its graphs in addition i find the little operator end extremely useful in indexing arrays as in x escapenumber end the notation is much more cumbersome in r using nrow and ncol recursively as in x escapenumber nrow x is there a package that might contain an implementation of the end operator thanks markus r help stat math ethz ch mailing list https stat ethz ch mailman listinfo r help please do read the posting guide http www r project org posting guide html and provide commented minimal self contained reproducible code

0, jordi gutierrez hermoso writes i realise it probably doesn't make much of a difference if the gpl is in a clickthrough since as i understand it you don't need to agree to the gpl to use the software and clickthrough agreements are probably almost always impossible to enforce so just out of academic curiousity what's the status of putting the gpl in such a clickthrough agreement does it make any difference or not the gpl explicitly permits use of the work by any recipient this is granted even in jurisdictions that sadly have copyright law that restricts the act of using copyrighted works so regardless of whether the person agrees to the license they have the freedom to use the work the problem comes when the installer refuses to install the work without receiving acceptance of the gpl this goes against what the license says i e that even a person who says no to such a question has the right to install and use the work having received such a work i suppose the license grants permission to use the work despite what the installer does so installing the software manually by extracting it in a way that avoids such a question would be explicitly granted that's a pointless hurdle to put before the user though ideally the meaningless accept the license step should be removed \\ beware of and eschew pompous prolixity charles a \\ beardsley o ben finney to unsubscribe email to debian legal request lists debian org with a subject of unsubscribe trouble contact listmaster lists debian org

0, new ticket created by alek storm please include the string perl escapenumber in the subject line of all future correspondence about this issue because pir can't tell the difference between invoking an object pmc and invoking a sub pmc it doesn't generate a correct set args when an object is invoked since the 'invoke' override is a method it expects the current object to be the first parameter there are currently two workarounds pass the current object explicitly as the first parameter or don't declare 'invoke' as a method the first is inconvenient and unintuitive and the second means 'invoke' doesn't get access to its own object example code for bug sub main pescapenumber newclass foo pescapenumber new foo pescapenumber bar end namespace foo sub 'invoke' method vtable param string bar say bar self 'baz' end sub 'baz' method say baz end output too few arguments passed escapenumber escapenumber params expected current instr 'parrot foo invoke' pc escapenumber home alek testescapenumber pir escapenumber called from sub ' ' pc escapenumber home alek testescapenumber pir escapenumber i've attached a patch that fixes this by grabbing the args signature inside delegate invoke and unshifting an arg of type parrot arg pmc parrot arg object it also modifies src inter call c to handle this by setting the arg equal to interp current object and enums h to add the new argument flag the tests in t pmc parrotobject t have been changed to include method on the 'invoke' overrides and to remove the test for escapenumber which is no longer applicable alek storm

escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber greg snow wrote if we go the route of converting perl scripts into windows executables then there is the perl power tools ppt project for perl that aims to create a cross platform set of common unix tools see http sourceforge net projects ppt or the current toolset can be downloaded from cpan the find utility has been included for a while and i think we could get the author of that one to help if all the unix tools needed by r are included in ppt then it may be possible to use those in rtools for an overall smaller footprint the find perl script could be compiled to an exe and given a different name so that it would not conflict with the windows find command there would need to be some switch or something to indicate using these tools rather than the standards for those that don't use the rtools but insteal installed perl and the other tools from duncan murdoch mailto murdoch stats uwo ca sent sat escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber

is important for a professionally working product that gets along with the rest of the windows system i don't because r building requires simulation of a subset of a unix environment so in case of a

escapenumber duncan murdoch wrote on escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber pm gabor grothendieck wrote it certainly would be excellent if installing perl could be eliminated one additional thing that i really dislike about the r installation is that one needs find on one's path and that conflicts with find on windows so other applications unrelated to r that use scripts can suddenly break because of r if that could be solved at the same time it would be nice at a minimum we should be able to wrap the calls to find in a macro so you could change the macro in mkrules and rename your copy from rtools to remove the conflict i'll take a look duncan murdoch on escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber duncan murdoch wrote on escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber pm greg snow wrote i have used the pp par combination for perl before it is pretty straight forward to convert an existing perl script into a stand alone windows executable both the activestate licence and the perl artistic licence allow for embedding a script and perl interpreter together and distributing the result the current perl script s used for the r package build package could easily be converted to a 'stand alone' windows executable and be distributed with rtools for those who do not want to install perl themselves the only drawback is that even a hello world script will result in over a meg sized executable due to the perl interpreter being included i took a quick look at the par page on cpan and it seems possible to build a dll that incorporates the interpreter and then each individual script exe could be much smaller i'll see if i can get that to work it would be really nice to be able to drop the perl requirement if we could do that i'd include the command line tools plus the compiled scripts with the basic r distribution so you could easily build simple packages the rtools exe installer would then just need to install the mingw compilers for packages containing compiled code and a few extras needed for building r i don't really know perl so i might be asking for advice if i get stuck duncan murdoch from r help bounces stat math ethz

0,record company whitney houston is straight as an arrow may escapenumber escapenumber by roger friedman search sources include google ask jeeves webcrawler whitney houston warner music group odds and ends whitney 'committed to her sobriety' ap whitney houston whitney houston is straight as an arrow not doing drugs and working hard in the studio that's the word from her record company monday in response to my weekend report from the bahamas that the recovering singer looked red eyed and stoned at stevie wonder 's spectacular birthday concert let's take whitney and her reps at their word why not the goal here is to see houston back in business healthy and restored to her former vibrancy pre bobby brown if it's happening and her appearance and attitude belie it well what the heck by the way the older man who was described as whitney's constant companion over the weekend was her brother gary a former drug addict who's been clean for some time a source says and he is also committed to his sobriety whitney they say has been in the studio now for more than a month she shows up at escapenumber p m stays as long as she's needed and is doing her practicing at home a source said as i reported in february among the producer writers she's working with are diane warren r kelly jermaine dupri and kenny babyface edmonds warren's song is titled i didn't know how much strength i had dupri cut his track last week i suppose whitney is distrustful of the press and she has every reason to be in the tabloids she has been sold out by just about every member of her ex husband's family not to mention former employees etc she's been the subject of the worst photographs in the history of any person famous or not it can't be easy but houston also has to take responsibility for the chaos she created in her career beginning in september escapenumber that's when she appeared on stage at madison square garden at michael jackson 's escapenumberth anniversary show looking anorexic and nearly dead from then on her public appearances were calamities culminating in her famous i can afford better drugs than crack interview with diane sawyer and let's not forget the atlanta landlord who found her in his rented condo two years ago high as a kite and living with a washed up pop singer let's hope that all this amounts now to houston we had a problem past tense whitney we're rooting for you warner music group a rejected escapenumber merger what if what if warner music group and emi music had merged in february escapenumber there might be a record business now alas it turns out that edgar bronfman jr had the chance in february escapenumber to merge the two companies remain ceo and brilliantly regroup into a powerhouse he could have combined the beatles with atlantic records' catalog streamlined into a mega giant and been awarded kudos from all corners no one knew this before now but papers filed as exhibits in a lawsuit brought against bronfman recently outline the whole mess as it went down the papers come from a suit brought by former simon schuster publisher richard snyder whom bronfman met over christmas escapenumber while on a family vacation in anguilla in escapenumber bronfman invited snyder to help create deals for investment after the former had botched involvements with vivendi universal and elsewhere snyder says that he was the architect of the warner music deal and that once it was completed bronfman unceremoniously dumped him and refused to give him his cut snyder is suing for escapenumber million bronfman says he merely rented office space to snyder who was down on his luck but the papers filed by snyder carefully indicate otherwise including memos in which snyder was cc'd and names of executives with whom snyder did business on behalf of bronfman the scion of the seagram's empire may be having memory issues that are worth exploring the most glaring of the documents attached to the snyder lawsuit a letter from emi chairman eric nicoli dated feb escapenumber escapenumber to bronfman and scott sperling of thomas h lee partners the firm that financed bronfman's wmg deal and now has a controlling stake in the company it's titled proposal for acquisition of warner recorded music and part of warner chappell music publishing in the letter nicoli outlines an offer to merge with bronfman's new wmg for escapenumber escapenumber billion in cash and reiterates a plan by which bronfman would become ceo of the enlarged emi group nicoli recommends that alain levy then head of emi music become ceo of the music group and martin bandier become ceo of emi music publishing it's that simple all nicoli asks is that his emi executives remain in place through the new company he reminds bronfman that the offer which would have solved numerous problems for both companies expires two days hence but bronfman didn't want the deal on feb escapenumber nicoli e mailed bronfman we understand you do not wish to pursue our offer he copied sperling bronfman circulated the e mail to snyder and to his brother in law alejandro zubillaga the pair as well as others connected to bronfman had been working for months to make the merger happen the next day bronfman sent a memo to roger ames the head of warner music to start consolidation i e layoffs we should not only get additional granularity on exactly which employees will be leaving we will also need to identify the top escapenumber or escapenumber people we will want to communicate with for retention bronfman's verbiage left a lot to be desired granularity is defined as the extent to which a system contains separate components like granules the more components in a system Â— or the greater the granularity Â— the more flexible it is in fact bronfman wanted fewer components and less flexibility what really surprises though through just the e mails and memos presented as exhibits is how much snyder had to with guiding bronfman and how little bronfman regarded snyder's involvement depositions in this case should be pretty interesting considering all the people with whom snyder worked to put the initial wmg deal together and the emi offer the emi merger was not just a momentary impulse snyder worked for months to put it together while another deal he helped orchestrate Â— the buying of warner music by bronfman et al from time warner Â— was getting ready to close evidence of the emi merger proposal is found in a business plan called wolf merges with elk which snyder oversaw wolf was warner elk was emi armed with this research snyder hosted bronfman and nicoli at his new york farm in january escapenumber to hammer out the details but bronfman Â— at the brink of fixing everything Â— balked his main problem he was worried that he could somehow be terminated from his position as ceo he also feared that emi's alain levy as number escapenumber in the company could unseat him when snyder then told bronfman jr that levy could not be terminated simply because bronfman jr regarded him as a rival bronfman jr became agitated court papers said in the end wolf did not merge with elk bronfman moved into new warner music digs and ceased relations with snyder abruptly as if the entire episode had never occurred bronfman fired lots of people and hired lyor cohen kevin liles and julie greenwald from island def jam last week warner music reported a escapenumber million loss for its second quarter compared to escapenumber million last year bronfman also fired escapenumber more staffers in the time since the escapenumber deal didn't go down ironies abound as well ames is not only gone but he now runs Â— emi levy and bandier are gone from emi bandier took over rival sony atv music publishing jason flom who was going to be the star of bronfman's new atlantic records is also at emi and this week emi is considering offers from private firms after receiving unacceptable bids from warner since this previously unknown one in escapenumber mccartney gets back gandolfini relieved just a p s to this item i told you a few weeks ago that paul mccartney had left capitol emi and took his back catalog with him now come reports that emi has reached a deal with mccartney for the entire solo release library from mccartney escapenumber through chaos and creation in the backyard escapenumber they will all soon be available for downloading too followed by the beatles catalog it's good news for emi although mccartney's new album memory almost full will be released on june escapenumber through starbucks' hear music concord records and distributed worldwide by universal music james gandolfini tells me he's relieved the sopranos is almost over i ran into gandolfini last night at the premiere of shrek the third where he brought his son and ex wife marcy sunday night's episode he said was very hard the whole season has been very hard he admitted the multi award winning actor is looking forward to new horizons with a new slimmed down profile and lots of offers if there's any justice he will win the emmy for this season also at shrek mike myers getting ready to start his new love guru movie in june and then a

0,the attached patch amends the i reg shift operators so that they produce results that are consistent with pmc shifts which produce the exact value escapenumber shifting left or right by at least the word size always produces zero and negative shift values are taken to mean shift in the other direction both of which i think are improvements over the c shift operators which seem to take the shift value modulo word size but i don't know how to describe the general case succinctly which could be a sign that it's the wrong thing it's not the same result modulo word size because the i reg result could change sign and mod never returns a negative number i think the result r would be r x escapenumber w r escapenumber w if r escapenumber w escapenumber if expressed in perl given the exact result in x and the word size in w is there a better way to describe this sign bashing modulus operator or is this not the right implementation tia bob rogers http rgrjr dyndns org escapenumber at least for left shifts and if bigint promotion is not disabled

s history officials are calling it the deadliest mass shooting in u s history today a gunman apparently acting alone went on a shooting spree killing at least escapenumber people in two locations and wounding at least escapenumber on the campus of virginia polytechnic institute and state university also known as virginia tech in blacksburg in addition the gunman was killed virginia tech police lieutenant wendell flinchum told reporters some of the victims were students he said at this time we believe there was only one gunman virginia congressmen tom davis and randy forbes who spoke by telephone with governor tim kaine's chief of staff and other officials citing virginia officials said a total of escapenumber people including the gunman were dead the governor's office could not confirm that number forbes said they believe the shooter was a student and that he turned the gun on himself but the virginia tech police department the lead agency in the case said it did not know where th e higher number had come from it said its count remained escapenumber dead including the shooter virginia tech president charles steger said authorities were working to identify the victims and notify their relatives today the university was struck with a tragedy that we consider of monumental proportions he said i cannot begin to convey my own personal sense of loss over this senseless and incomprehensible heinous act president bush was horrified by the shootings white house spokeswoman dana perino said his immediate reaction was one of deep concern for the families of the victims the victims themselves the students the professors and all the people of virginia who have dealt with this shocking incident she said the u s senate and house of representatives each held a moment of silence police were alerted to the shootings at around escapenumber escapenumber a m when they were notified in a escapenumber call that there were several victims at west ambler johnston hall a four story dormitory on campus steger said about two hours later more shootings were reported in nearby norris hall he said many of those hurt are hospitalized we heard some loud banging said a student who identified himself as josh a junior who was in a building near west ambler johnston hall we weren't sure if it was construction or not and then we heard some people screaming he said that after he and other students heard escapenumber to escapenumber shots they jumped from a second story window and ran to safety it was very hectic i've never experienced anything like this before he said classes are canceled for the remainder of today and tomorrow three soldiers killed in iraq u s reports three american soldiers were killed today in baghdad the u s military announced two other soldiers were killed saturday in falluja commanders said in a written statement one soldier was killed when his patrol came under small arms fire in southwestern baghdad the military said and another was killed by a roadside bomb in the southern part of the city an explosively formed projectile struck another baghdad patrol killing one soldier and wounding two others the falluja deaths took place in a roadside bomb attack the military said their deaths bring number of u s troops killed in iraq to escapenumber escapenumber since the escapenumber invasion that toppled former dictator saddam hussein white house condemns russian opposition crackdown today the white house criticized russia's weekend crackdown on anti government protests including what it called the heavy handed use of police to break up demonstrations in moscow and st petersburg hundreds of anti kremlin protesters clashed with riot police yesterday in st petersburg a day after a similar demonstration in moscow the protesters accused russian president vladimir putin of rolling back democratic reforms and persecuting his political opponents we underscore that allowing peaceful expressions of protest is an essential element of democracy and a universally recognized human right white house spokeswoman dana perino said the marches which the government had banned were cut short by riot police perino accused russian authorities of an emerging pattern of use of excessive force by the authorities in reaction to similar events and called the arrests of journalists covering the protests intolerable there is no immediate response from russi an officials pres bush pushes democrats before meeting on war spending today president bush made clear that while he will use meetings with democrats this week to discuss a new supplemental bill for the iraq war he is unlikely to give much ground on major issues of dispute i am willing to discuss any way forward that does not hamstring our troops set an artificial timetable for withdrawal and spend billions on projects not related to the war mister bush said senate majority leader harry reid responded that the president has a choice to make in the coming days cling to the discredited policies that have led our troops further into this intractable civil war or work with a bipartisan majority in congress to make us more secure the president in televised remarks before a supportive group of military families at the white house slammed democrats for rejecting the bill he sent to congress he also condemned the versions of the bill passed by the house and senate saying they would undercut our troops and would impose restrictio ns on our military commanders the american people expect the leaders in washington to find common ground but they also expect the congress and the white house to work together to make sure our troops get funded quickly we should not legislate defeat in this vital war he said he added i hope the democratic leadership will drop their unreasonable demands for a precipitous withdrawal wicked weather pounds the mid atlantic northeast a powerful nor'easter continued to pound the mid atlantic coast today prompting acting new jersey

0,by way of introduction we quickly hit the law of diminishing returns when we spend a lot of time justifying the existence of parrot especially when we could be spending that time finishing off parrot at the end of the day no amount of talking will convince the skeptics a completed virtual machine in production use will convince more and make the remaining skeptics irrelevant that said i've spent some time here in the hope that this can work its way into a document so next time these questions come around we can say read the faq will coleda wrote escapenumber why parrot http www parrotcode org docs intro html parrot is designed with the needs of dynamically typed languages such as perl and python in mind and should be able to run programs written in these languages more efficiently than vms developed with static languages in mind jvm net parrot is also designed to provide interoperability between languages that compile to it in theory you will be able to write a class in perl subclass it in python and then instantiate and use that subclass in a tcl program a what precisely about parrot makes possible more efficient execution of a dynamically typed language than would be the case with the jvm or the clr this is an old faq entry that needs to be updated at the time it was written there was an enormous gap between parrot and the performance of the jvm clr in handling dynamic languages note not just dynamically typed languages dynamic typing is one small aspect of dynamic languages in general the jvm clr have made progress but they're still not all the way to full handling of dynamic languages they think they are and are quite happy to sit back and declare that they have the dynamic languages problem licked the only way they're ever going to tackle the full problem is if someone else does it first to show them how just like the only reason they ever tried working on dynamic languages in the first place was because parrot was there to show that a virtual machine could do more than they imagined possible back to the specific question dynamic typing is probably one of the least interesting features of parrot it's handled by the fact that a pmc container can hold any type of pmc and assignment between types is handled by a set of standard vtable functions on the source pmc for retrieving its value and on the destination pmc for setting its value b whatever that is how will it adversely impact the execution of statically typed languages including type inferred languages since type declarations are not required implementing a statically typed language on a dynamically typed virtual machine means adding additional code to do the type checking this is likely less efficient than implementing a statically typed language on a statically typed virtual machine though likely not much less efficient since the statically typed virtual machine still has to do the type checking someday we'll run some benchmarks to compare c how will this impact the execution of statically typed code in perl python and other targeted languages that question doesn't make sense perl and python don't have statically typed code see escapenumberb for comments on efficiency of statically typed languages in general we aren't targeting static languages again i'm referring to a more general category than just statically typed languages we may implement a few static languages on parrot so they can use parrot's libraries and tools static languages don't take advantage of the advanced features of a dynamic virtual machine they may not be fast in an interpreted environment because they aren't designed for an interpreted environment they're specifically designed to take advantage of a statically compiled environment by eliminating all dynamic features i'm not going to get into a discussion of whether static languages or dynamic languages are better they're just different creatures and comparing them is about as useful as comparing a hybrid car optimized for fuel economy with a race car optimized to win the daytona escapenumber escapenumber general features a how will parrot support reflection and attributes simply put reflection is the ability for code to access information about itself and modify its own behavior this is a concept so deeply ingrained in the design of parrot that the hard part of answering the question isn't figuring out how parrot supports reflection but figuring out which particular features to highlight how about the fact than instead of using a stack to control the flow of a program it uses introspectable continuation objects or the fact that subroutines exceptions and namespaces are all introspectable modifiable and can be replaced by subclasses with different behavior as long as they respect the interface by attributes do you mean instance variables for objects what parrot calls an attribute or do you mean auxiliary data attached to an object what the clr calls an attribute and parrot calls a property parrot implements both b how will parrot support generics types generics are mostly a static language way of allowing a tiny bit of semi dynamic behavior there are many ways to do the same thing in parrot the most literal minded parallel would be declaring a class that accepts a parameter on instantiation specifying the type of some element that it contains or operates on for example the following code might be used to instantiate a generic aggregate that holds elements of type myelement pescapenumber find class mygenericaggregate pescapenumber pescapenumber new elementtype 'myelement' c how will parrot support interface types an interface is a role with no attributes and no implementation for its methods or more specifically it has implementations for its methods that throw an exception complaining that the method needs to be implemented d what kind of security models will parrot support the architecture is still in early stages let us know if there's a particular model you need in general we're taking a sandbox approach e how will parrot support small footprint systems the absolute minimum needed to run parrot is a bytecode interpreter we're aiming to fit a bytecode interpreter in escapenumberm extremely small but that's what's needed to run on most modern cell phones there isn't currently active development work in this area f how will parrot support direct access to unmanaged resources my original answer was that unmanaged resources are a notion from the clr and not really meaningful in the parrot context but from your followup message it sounds like you actually mean access to c level resources unmanagedstruct which joshua mentioned is one way and provides a parrot interface to a c structure that isn't memory managed by parrot nci is another way allowing calls into and returns from c functions in general parrot will never provide direct access to c level resources it will only provide access through an interface where the interface handles the translation between c like behavior and parrot like behavior as much as possible those interfaces are defined in a standard way so that using a new external resource from within parrot doesn't require writing an entirely new interface layer from scratch but only requires reusing or easily extending an existing interface layer g how will parrot facilitate distributed processing parrot will provide a standard set of tools for concurrency and the fact that parrot provides a standard interface across multiple platforms is an advantage to distributed processing distributed code can be written to run on the parrot virtual machine abstracting away from the details of the particular hardware or operating system we'll also provide a standard set of networking protocols and tools for managing some of the standard distributed messaging systems soap json ajax etc we don't currently have any plans to support more advanced forms of serializing an execution state to carry between systems but they could be hooked into the core extensible concurrency framework escapenumber parrot pmc issues the parrot pmc vtable provides a large number of optional functions which pmcs can either implement or not if not implemented they will throw an exception at runtime or will fall back to a default implementation a what support will parrot provide a compiler to interrogate a pmc at compile time to know what it actually implements some custom vtable functions like can does and isa but when all else fails you can fall back on inspect which gives you all the nitty gritty details about a pmc object all of these functions appear to be predefined because there is no mechanism for extending this functionality at runtime it appears that compilers will be limited to implementing functionality that is defined in the vtable the vtable contains the common operations required by certain languages what kind of dynamic virtual machine would we be if we didn't allow functionality to be extended at runtime pmcs are just objects to extend the functionality at runtime subclass the pmc and extend the subclass or add a runtime role to the object b how will parrot handle languages with operations that are not provided parrot provides low level operations if the hll has a more complex feature the compiler translates it down to a series of low level operations ultimately all languages compile down to machine code so i'm not at all likely to be convinced that an hll may come up with a feature that can't be implemented as a combination of low level operations http www parrotcode org docs vtables html to be perfectly honest this is a slightly flawed example since it's unlikely that there will be a distinct python scalar pmc class the python compiler could well type inference variables such that a would be a pythonstring and b would be a pythonnumber but the point remains incrementing a pythonstring is very different from incrementing a perlscalar this document is very old and currently being replaced c how will parrot address cross language semantics all languages are implemented in terms of low level parrot operations a given language can have any semantics it wants it just composes that behavior from low level components when one language is interacting with objects from another language it performs standard parrot operations on those objects so the objects can respond in the same way they would respond to the same operations called from their own language i once spent an hour trying to explain this to the clr guys and they just couldn't understand it d will each language have to provide its own support for interacting with pmcs for other languages no all they need to do is call standard opcodes on the pmc from other languages each pmc provides its own vtable functions for as an example returning a string integer number or pmc value e how will a perlscalar interact with a pythonstring interact how if you assign the value of a pythonstring to a perlscalar the value will be extracted by a standard vtable function on the pythonstring and assigned by a vtable function on the perlscalar f what will happen when a pythonstring is incremented in perl code the code will call the increment vtable function on the pythonstring pmc comparing the vtable for a pmc to the jvm and clr base object classes the pmc is essentially an abstract class with dozens of unimplemented methods while java's object provides and implements the following public methods equals getclass hashcode notify notifyall tostring wait this doesn't make any sense are you comparing parrot's default pmc to java's object it would make more sense to compare parrot's object to java's object discounting the methods related to java's peculiar threading implementation that's equals getclass hashcode tostring similarly the clr's cts object provides equals referenceequals gettype gethashcode tostring and parrot's object provides isa can does get attr set attr get class inspect name find method g why is it a good thing that pmcs essentially non contractual abstract base classes that define a lot of functionality without implementing it parrot implements sane defaults for the majority of pmcs but considering the wide range of types implemented as pmcs scalars aggregates subroutines coroutines continuations namespaces exceptions threads iterators stm etc there really isn't a sane default for most operations that will apply to all pmc types so instead the sane defaults are built up by a chain of inheritance for example all the different array types inherit sane defaults from a core array type perhaps what you're trying to ask is why we define a standard set of vtable operations instead of allowing a pmc to create any arbitrary vtable entries this goes back to the core design of interoperability across languages all pmcs are guaranteed to provide a sane response to the standard vtable operations even if that response is a not implemented exception h why is there no first tier depth in parrot's type system such as pmcstring pmcintger pmcnumber at the time the initial pmc system was implemented parrot had no notion of namespaces that is changing now though we'll never have a namespace hierarchy level called pmc as that's an implementation detail not type information and yes types are connected to namespace hierarchies though it's not always a one to one correspondence escapenumber parrot vm issues parrot provides what it calls registers with no guarantee that these map to hardware registers a will any registers ever map in a parrot controlled way to hardware registers well of course they sometimes map to hardware registers underneath b how can a compiler efficiently allocate registers if it does not know which ones will map to hardware registers hand rolled allocation is never as efficient or as reliable as programmatic allocation the virtual machine handles the efficient allocation of registers the hll compiler running on the virtual machine doesn't pay any attention to it this is an advantage of parrot allowing new hlls to be quickly and easily implemented without reinventing low level wheels like garbage collection and register allocation escapenumber parrot design issues parrot has many operators and number of core pmc types for them to operate on parrot has so many operators that it appears to be using them instead of having a standard library this is markedly different than the clr and jvm systems a why was this done this way by operator i'm assuming you mean opcode since this is a virtual machine the only real difference between an opcode and a function is how you call it see the last two entries in b what is the basis for deciding what will be an operator it's essentially a design decision of how core the operation is how frequently it will be used and how standard it will be across all the languages implemented on parrot non core rarely used or behavior that varies widely between languages isn't canonized as an opcode or is canonized as an opcode that simply calls the relevant vtable function on a pmc c how can substantial quantities of additional functionality be added to this design cleanly as libraries dynamically loaded opcode libraries libraries of low level functions or libraries written in pir or an hll and compiled to bytecode allison

0,hi all i have been using princomp recently its very useful indeed but i have a question about how to specify the rows of data you want it to choose i have a set of variables relating to bird characteristics and i have been using princomp to produce pc scores from these however since i have multiple duplicate entries per individual each bird had a varying number of chicks i only want princomp to treat each individual bird as the sample and not include all the duplicates then i want to replicate the pc scores for all the duplicated rows for that individual any idea how to do this up to now i have been using princomp to only select the entries which are not duplicated which is easy but the difficult bit is the programming to duplicate the pc scores across the entries for each individual i developed something that worked but it takes about escapenumber minutes to run thanks for all your help very much appreciated simon simon pickett phd student centre for ecology and conservation tremough campus university of exeter in cornwall trescapenumberez tel escapenumber r help stat math ethz ch mailing list https stat ethz ch mailman listinfo r help please do read the posting guide http www r project org posting guide html and provide commented minimal self contained reproducible code

escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber update shuttle mission extended two days fourth spacewa lk added blanket repair ordered escapenumber nasa's mission management team decided today to extend the shuttle atlantis ' mission by two days and to add a fourth spacewalk sunday that will give the astronauts enough time to complete their space station assembly tasks a nd fix a pulled up insulation blanket on one of the ship's aft rocket pods flight controllers plan to make a decision tuesday on whether to add the b lanket repair to the third or fourth spacewalk based on our analysis today we have upped our desire to fix this said j ohn shannon chairman of nasa's mission management team we were looking a t flight history saying this doesn't look like a big deal then you go loo k at your analysis tools and say hey i could really damage the top surface of my structure and i sure don't want to do that so let's go have a good effort to repair it before we come home landing at the kennedy space center now is targeted for around escapenumber escapenumber p m on june escapenumber the protruding insulation was spotted by the shuttle astronauts during a ro utine post launch payload bay survey using the shuttle's robot arm a camer a on the arm spotted a triangular escapenumber inch by escapenumber inch corner of a two inch thi ck insulation blanket that was sticking up and bent back engineers later c oncluded air rushing over the rocket pod during the shuttle 's climb out of the lower atmosphere worked its way into a corner or seam and peeled the b lanket back the concern is that hot air during re entry could damage the underlying gra phite epoxy structure of the left side orbital maneuvering system rocket po d during the escapenumber minutes or so of peak heating the temperatures on the oms pods reach escapenumber to escapenumber escapenumber degree fahrenheit while engineers do not view thi s as a life or death sort of problem shuttles have safely returned to ear th with much more serious oms pod damage there are enough unknowns to pro mpt caution we have limitations in our ability to analyze this shannon said you're going to have a temperature that exceeds that top face coat capability ho w long it would take to completely erode is very questionable no one could give me that answer so the right answer here the better part of valor w as to go and put it down and secure it at the extreme altitude of peak heating there is little aerodynamic pressu re shannon said and simply folding the corner back down and tucking it in might be sufficient engineers are still assessing techniques for securing the blanket if necessary engineers used post columbia software to model what might happen if the bla nket ripped away during the later stages of the descent when the airflow i s stronger and concluded it would not hit the shuttle as it turns out the material used in the blanket will make the fix relative ly straight forward if you take this blanket and you pull it up like the wind is hitting it i t'll stay up like that shannon said it's got some memory but when you push it back down it stays down that's something we're kind of counting o n we think the astronauts will be able to go out there and just push this right back down they're working right now different ways to attach it to t he blanket that's laying beside it or maybe to attach it to the tile face t hat's in front of it the repair work is expected to take escapenumber minutes to two hours to complete an astronaut his feet anchored to an extension on the end of the shuttle's r obot arm will be maneuvered back to the left side oms pod and push the fla p down it may be possible to attempt the repair during the crew's third spacewalk friday but that would require a major push to complete the procedures in t ime by adding a fourth spacewalk mission managers can preserve their options f or dealing with the blanket and any problems that might develop later this week when flight controllers attempt to retract the pescapenumber escapenumberb solar array the pescapenumber arrays provided the initial power to u s modules during the early p hases of construction now pescapenumber needs to be retracted moved out to its perm anent location on the left end of the station's main solar power truss and re extended shuttle astronauts ran into major problems retracting the pescapenumber escapenumberb solar blank et last december and the atlantis astronauts may have similar problems with the pescapenumber escapenumberb wing that is still extended flight controllers will begin retra ction procedures wednesday and astronauts steve swanson and patrick forrest er will be standing by to assist if necessary additional pescapenumber escapenumberb retraction time is built into a third spacewalk friday wi th the decision to fix the pulled up blanket nasa managers opted to add a fourth spacewalk to ensure enough eva time is available to handle the repai r and any problems that might crop up during the pescapenumber retraction it was a very easy decision shannon said he added that engineers have completed their initial assessment of atlantis ' nose cap wing

0,i tried this with vmware player i was going to load up the ubuntu escapenumber escapenumber iso and install it on a virtual machine this way i used easyvmx com to generate the proper files and chose the es whatever sound card it would use by default everything seemed to go ok until orca loaded and i got odd static like noises instead of speech i think sound is definitely broken some how in vmware player i might uninstall that and try server instead original message from jeremy to sent wednesday april escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber am subject re vmware late reply to one of the earlier posts on this subject i had asked a question about how to get a installation of linux running in a vm and i have to say that i did get it working it turned out to be very easy but i was wondering about sound support in the vm as i was just using speakup through my serial port it was kind of cool when i got it working as i was on skype on the windows host and it never gave me any trouble but i am guessing that getting some sort of software synth working would not work unless i had another soundcard to rout it through i am not even sure if i can find drivers for my soundcard that is built into this laptop but that is a question for another time i suppose if someone can tell me more about how this kind of thing works that would be wonderful i noticed that someone did get software speech going with a vm so figured i would ask thanks bunches speakup mailing list speakup braille uwo ca http speech braille uwo ca mailman listinfo speakup speakup mailing list speakup braille uwo ca http speech braille uwo ca mailman listinfo speakup

research because they perceive it as high risk said dr nicole szlezak a harvard researcher who is science officer for escapelong certain tools that are needed for drug development in any disease are

escapenumber the business of survival mode pf the boston globe the business of survival a b school graduate turns his disease into a business plan one that he hopes could literally save his life by stephen smith globe staff may escapenumber escapenumber avi kremer's thoughts and words are locked in a constant hare and tortoise race words unable to keep pace with thoughts it is the singular burden of als the mind remains fiercely active even as the connections from brain to mouth fray kremer diagnosed with the disease just months after enrolling in harvard business school begins a sentence and stops then starts again and stops sometimes when a word proves especially recalcitrant he shakes his head and smiles i have developed a lot of patience he said kremer whose wheelchair sports a borat the comedian bumpersticker has not let the disease steal his humor his determination his deep desire to be innovative so he decided to take what he had learned at harvard and apply it to a condition that is invariably lethal his disease became his business plan avi moved very quickly from the anger stage after diagnosis to a very applied entrepreneurial stage when he said 'let's get on with it let's find the solution let's put the resources on the table to empower research ' said kremer's neurologist dr robert brown of massachusetts general hospital with the help of his business school buddies and luminaries in neurology research kremer now escapenumber started a scientific competition called escapelong modeled on the x prize which rewards adventurers if they complete a certain challenge neurologists said they have never heard of anything quite like it usually researchers get grants as seed money on the front end of their scientific pursuits escapelong takes that dogma and turns it inside out scientists get the prize money only after solving crucial questions about als solutions that could hasten discovery of drugs to slow the disease but once kremer and his classmates had the idea for a prize the next question was how would they raise the money they came up with the idea of offering potential donors a money back guarantee if our scientific contest yields results that's your dividend if there's no solution to the riddle we'll return your donation the pitch is working in less than a year kremer has generated escapenumber escapenumber million in contributions a few months back former israeli prime minister ehud barak arranged for kremer once a wiry platoon leader in the israeli defense forces to meet with new england patriots owner robert kraft who was so moved that he donated escapenumber escapenumber i don't think that they're giving us their money out of pity because otherwise robert kraft could have given us escapenumber escapenumber not escapenumber escapenumber kremer said but i do think that the fact that i'm afflicted by als i think they're really convinced of the message that we are going to use the money wisely because my life depends on it rena clark vice president of community affairs and corporate philanthropy for the patriots has sat through dozens of presentations from worthy causes this was by far the most emotional she said avi is fighting a pretty valiant fight here that fight begins and ends every day in a dormitory suite on the harvard business school campus where kremer's work as a research associate has allowed him to continue to live since his escapenumber graduation in his two room suite there's a photo of kremer and his military pals and another picture frame emblazoned with the message the sky's the limit class of escapenumber there's a phone with big buttons to make it easier to dial and a bathroom with a wide door to accommodate kremer's motorized wheelchair a banner in the living room proclaims cure als even as his condition deteriorates kremer manages to navigate the terrain of the business school campus using his foot to jab at the buttons that automatically open doors until recently he traveled across the nation meeting with anyone who would listen to his story now his campaign is waged largely via computer modified so that he can move the mouse by moving his head patients with narratives to tell have changed the course of research in other diseases from cancer to parkinson's to spinal cord injuries having kremer as the face of escapelong brings a sense of urgency said lorenzo refolo who heads als programs at the national institute of neurological disorders and stroke it brings a sense of need the first sign that something might be wrong with avi kremer arrived a few months before he landed in boston an odd tremor shook his right forearm it's probably nothing kremer figured but the twitch persisted as he prepared to leave his hometown of haifa the heart of northern israel by the time he started his studies at harvard kremer had begun to suspect something might be seriously wrong brown made the diagnosis amyotrophic lateral sclerosis a condition afflicting as many as escapenumber escapenumber americans not much has changed since baseball legend lou gehrig died of als in escapenumber most patients still live only three to five years after diagnosis and only escapenumber percent including famed scientist stephen hawking last a decade or more kremer's dresser is testament to that hopelessness it is freighted with vitamins and supplements which he trusts will give him strength and sustenance there's only one medication for als which kremer takes but the pill only extends survival by a few months it was the frustratingly slow pace of research into als that goaded kremer and his friends into action traditional fund raising and donations to traditional nonprofit organizations weren't providing the catalyst for research said nate boaz a classmate of kremer's and co founder of escapelong big pharmaceutical companies and even smaller biotechnology firms generally avoid als research because they perceive it as high risk said dr nicole szlezak a harvard researcher who is science officer for escapelong certain tools that are needed for drug development in any disease are not in place in als and that's because als is little understood szlezak said scientists can't even say for sure why the nerve cells that steer muscles known as motor neurons start to die leading to a relentless weakening of muscles from the limbs to the diaphragm with patients ultimately dying because they can no longer breathe escapelong aims to jump start the field by enlisting scientists the world over last november it released the first of its

esteemed people in the field of als research ask about whether this is a diversion of resources and energy that will actually slow progress he said still there are encouraging signs escapelong scientists this month selected five winners in the first round of the challenge giving each escapenumber escapenumber the deadline for a prize of escapenumber million is november escapenumber some of those entries came from people who had nothing to do with the als research community and their interest was entirely sparked by this prize approach said adrian j ivinson director of the harvard center for neurodegeneration repair and a member of the escapelong scientific advisory board we didn't know how the scientific community would react we didn't know if people would turn their nose up at it out of principle next month kremer plans to return to israel his little sister is giving birth to her first child kremer's first nephew the family will celebrate the arrival of a new generation and

0,as i was working on a solution to the fact that my system provides the readahead function but not a declaration for that function i discovered that readahead is documented as conforming to the readahead system call is linux specific and its use should be avoided in portable applications given this it is possible that different linux versions may conceivably use slightly different prototypes for readahead so providing a declaration in lib replace is somewhat dangerous in researching this i discovered what appears to be a posix replacement it looks like readahead is equivalent to posix fadvise posix fadv willneed the only place that readahead is used i think is in vfs readahead c it might make sense for the maintainer of this module to look into using posix fadvise instead of readahead cheers derrell

0,hi all the following patch series alters the sambaescapenumber security context handling to better support group semantics in freebsd and darwin in freebsd and i believe most bsd flavours the first gid t in the kernel credential's groups array is the effective group id this is always returned by getgroups escapenumber and is assumed to be the first gid t in the groups array passed in via setgroups escapenumber some bsd systems will set the effective group id to be group escapenumber from setgroups escapenumber others will simply ignore groups escapenumber either way the right thing to do is to guarantee that the effective group id we want is in groups escapenumber when we call setgroups escapenumber this patch series also alters the order of operations used to make a security context current in order to obey the rather unique rules that darwin has wrt it's dynamic group membership implementation see patch escapenumber since this alters the security context handling please review carefully i'd like to apply these patches to samba escapenumber escapenumber and samba escapenumber escapenumber james peach jpeach samba org

0,on escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber bob rogers wrote i like this one but i also have another alternative first make all class modification code add method remove attribute etc return a pmc whenever one of these methods is called on a class the class is cloned what does find class return after one of these if it returns the new class then there is no need for the class mutating ops to do so except possibly for convenience find class returns whatever is currently registered as the class a class modifying method doesn't change that it just returns the cloned class pmc if the hll wants to register the modified version it can do so but i'm not in favor of a separate class registry and i've heard it's going away anyway in any case it should be left up to the hll what it wants to do with the modified class since one approach doesn't work with all languages classobj newclass 'foo' object classobj 'new' add method returns a clone of the original class with bar added c keeps its reference to the original class classobj classobj 'add method' 'bar' pescapenumber objectescapenumber classobj 'new' surely you are not suggesting that any random add method should require creating a new class did you mean add attribute or whatever of course add method's create new classes the implementation of that is what we've been talking about we want the class to be modified but already instantiated objects keep their reference to the class they were created with allocating a new class for every add method add attribute etc is a downside when there are several in a row and all we want is the end result but i've already proposed a solution to that create a shortcut method that takes a list or slurpy of attributes to add so it's all done at once the only downside i can think of is the overhead involved in creating a new clone of the class for every change to it for example when many attributes are added at once this is not necessary you only need to clone the class after the first time it is instantiated so you can put an instantiated p flag in the class to keep track and keep mutating the same new class until the next instantiation the remove operations could stay they would just throw errors on instantiated classes that's a great idea and is probably better than my shortcut method idea we'll have to see what others think but i'm not sure why remove would be any different than add they create a clone of the class and remove the attribute instantiated objects of the class don't notice a thing but in that case it might be simpler for hll code to stick to allison's original alternative escapenumber i e make an explicit clone mutate it as required and then install it as the class returned by find class not all languages want to clone their classes on modification these languages would use their own class pmcs that don't clone themselves if one of their classes is passed to and cloned by a different hll their class system will be screwed up inconsistent i'm not sure how requiring hlls to deal with explicit cloning would be simpler than having it abstracted away this system is much more flexible error recovery would also be easier for explicit cloning what happens if one of the class mutating methods throws an error i'm afraid you lost me how would this be different could you provide some more information alek storm

0, jonathan scott duff duff pobox com escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber you mention oop for perl escapenumber we have a standard if very general syntax and open semantics that have allowed people to implement oop in a variety of ways this was all well and good for a while until we realized that there should be some more reasonable defaults in both syntax and semantics for common operations in oop oop in perlescapenumber has a mechanism but not a standard in the use of those features full oo languages all choose a direction but there are serious culture differences perl uses them all there are many ways how to instantiate an object which is lot of fun as programmer but a hassle for the average programmer within one program you may very well need to use different instantiation techniques of course this could have been forseen perl is not the first language which implements oo and some advice on the convention to use could have avoided wild collection of approaches we see now this is also why perl best practices is a good book shameless plug although i would have welcomed it escapenumber years earlier i think it's the same thing with podescapenumber it's open enough that many documentation systems can be built from it man pages books magazines wikis etc for some of those documentation systems we'll have nice conventions and other conventions will grow as needed if we find that convention isn't enough in specific areas without any doubt there are thousands of documentation systems around at least ten percent of them are considered the best ever made by its developer or developer community just by simple math the chance that the system developed really is the best is less than one percent gladly there are many areas of application for documentation systems and there is a large variety in taste by the users so per user usage a different doc system can be the best still its a muddy terrain podescapenumber has the unique opportunity to become the best documentation system for a specific large group of users perl programmers tenth of thousands of people will use podescapenumber in their perlescapenumber programs every day imo any argument that podescapenumber is good because it can be used to write books or express complex mathematical expressions is really frightning me damian is correctly avoiding this in his argument is this another area where our community is trying to incorporate every thinkable feature in some design and in the process producing such a complex design that it deserves an extra volume in programming perl escapenumber next to the escapenumber page volumes for each of basic syntax grammars and oo imo the needs for podescapenumber are much simpler a way to document the features of the related perlescapenumber code and smooth that into parts of manual pages if you write a book than use podescapenumber to docbook or podescapenumber to pod or whatever to get some fragments in your some documentation system which is specialized in books every single complication added to the doc syntax will make it not to understand for a large percentage of the primar target community as every teacher can tell you from experience also i don't think that documentation is being treated as second class at all it's being treated as first class but different it's treated second class in the perlescapenumber sense the tools are not an integral part of the perlescapenumber environemnt when i create a program it starts with a goal to reach that goal i have to write some code some docs some tests for me it is all part of the program i do not see one to be of more importance than the other all three are first class sitizens in my program and what i really wish for is that those three work together in een kiss way to achieve my goal in no time so i can drink more beer yeh on the subject of tests b markov mark overmeer msc markov solutions mark overmeer net solutions overmeer net http mark overmeer net http solutions overmeer net

0,may escapenumber escapenumber bush requests escapenumber billion to fight aids by sheryl gay stolberg washington may escapenumber Â— president bush called wednesday for congress to spend escapenumber billion to fight global aids over the next five years a near doubling of financing that is part of a white house effort to burnish mr bushÂ’s humanitarian credentials before he meets leaders of the group of escapenumber industrialized nations next week the initiative if approved would build on a program that grew out of the presidentÂ’s escapenumber state of the union address when he asked for escapenumber billion over five years for prevention treatment and care of aids patients in developing countries congress approved more than escapenumber billion but the program is set to expire next year mr bushÂ’s announcement delivered in the white house rose garden adds to what has become an unexpectedly high priority for the white house aids was not a signature issue for mr bush when he ran for office in escapenumber but it has become one in part because the christian conservatives who make up his political base have embraced it and in part because mr bush wants to build a legacy for the united states and a more compassionate image abroad to counter international criticism of american policies in the wake of the sept escapenumber escapenumber attacks that sentiment was reflected in mr bushÂ’s remarks on wednesday Â“once again the generosity of the american people is one of the great untold stories of our time Â” he said Â“our citizens are offering comfort to millions who suffer and restoring hope to those who feel forsaken Â” aids advocacy organizations praised mr bush for proposing the additional money but said the plan Â— which he said would provide drugs for escapenumber escapenumber million patients Â— did not go nearly far enough toward meeting the international communityÂ’s stated goal of treating the estimated escapenumber million patients in developing nations Â“itÂ’s a modest increase itÂ’s important that he reaffirmed it but we will need the next president to do more Â” said paul zeitz executive director of the global aids alliance a nonprofit advocacy group Â“weÂ’re not getting ahead of the aids crisis weÂ’re tempering it Â” administration officials concede that point and say the white house is hoping mr bushÂ’s announcement will prod other group of escapenumber countries as well as nations that have growing economies to make spending commitments of their own Â“the goal of universal access isnÂ’t a united states goal itÂ’s a global goal Â” said mark r dybul the administrationÂ’s global aids coordinator Â“the rest of the world is going to need to respond if we are going to achieve these goals Â” international development and human rights issues will be high on the agenda of next weekÂ’s summit but so will climate change Â— an issue on which mr bush finds himself at odds with his fellow group of escapenumber leaders notably the meetingÂ’s host chancellor angela merkel of germany dan bartlett counselor to mr bush said the president intended to address climate change in a speech on thursday at the united states agency for international development but so far this week mr bush has been devoting most of his attention to human rights and poverty issues that draw him less criticism than his stance on climate change in an interview monday night a senior administration official said mr bush planned to spend the week in advance of the group of escapenumber conference spotlighting humanitarian issues and Â“demonstrating u s leadership around the world Â” on tuesday mr bush announced he was imposing stiff economic sanctions on sudan to press its government into cooperating with a united nations peacekeeping force that is trying to end the violence in darfur on wednesday in addition to the aids announcement mr bush named robert b zoellick his former trade representative as his candidate to head the world bank calling the nominee Â“a committed internationalistÂ” who Â“wants to help struggling nations defeat poverty Â” in thursdayÂ’s speech mr bush also intends to talk about education programs in the developing world and his initiative to combat malaria the aids initiative which is likely to generate bipartisan support in congress would cover federal spending for the escapenumber to escapenumber fiscal years meaning the vast majority of the money would be spent after mr bush left office to promote it the white house is sending laura bush to africa next month Â“she and i share a passion Â” mr bush said Â“we believe that to whom much is given much is required Â” the united nations reports that there are nearly escapenumber million people worldwide living with h i v the virus that causes aids last year three million died from their infections in his announcement in escapenumber mr bush said he was committed to offering treatment for two million h i v patients by escapenumber but so far he said the program called the presidentÂ’s emergency plan for aids relief has paid for treatment for just escapenumber escapenumber million people in escapenumber nations advocates complain that the new goal bringing the number of patients treated to escapenumber escapenumber million is not that much more ambitious than the old one Â“by escapenumber there will be escapenumber million people that urgently need medicines Â” mr zeitz said the white house however said that in addition to providing treatment for escapenumber escapenumber million the new money would prevent escapenumber million new infections and provide care for more than escapenumber million people mr bartlett said the president was convinced americaÂ’s image in the world would improve because of it Â“iÂ’ve heard him talk about this is a part of america that gets overlooked Â” he said Â“and that over time people will look back and say Â‘at a point in time where america may have been under scrutiny for other reasons look at the significant contribution they have made they saved more lives than anybody could have imagined Â’ Â” thiru balasubramaniam geneva representative knowledge

0,austin hastings a similar trade off exists with the statement terminating semicolon in this case it involves the number of statements per line a language that terminates statements can ignore whitespace allowing multiple statements per line and statements that span multiple lines still possible with optional semicolons as you say later a escapenumber b \\ escapenumber c escapenumber d escapenumber the vast majority of languages have opted to terminate statements most of the younger scripting languages didn't probably the best argument is that encountering a semicolon or full stop in cobol is a positive indicator rather than a negative one i see a semicolon i know the statement is over as opposed to i don't see a continuation marker so it's likely that the statement is over although it could be tabbed way off to the right or something your semicolon could also be tabbed way off so you can't be sure there either i see no semicolon so it's likely that the statement continues on the next line so line termination doesn't gain a punctuation character no problem i think and causes the ends of lines to be uncertain it's exactly as certain as with semicolon termination see above it does reduce typing for the small crowd of people that wouldn't just use them anyway because they use them in every other language i think the lack of value here outweights the savings of one character per line but even if the advantage of line termination is low some characters saved some people might say it looks cleaner i cannot see any advantage of semicolon termination thomas wittek http gedankenkonstrukt de jabber streawkceur jabber i pobox net

is guaranteed in this business but if you manage your risk properly buying at the right point is very important in this regard stories like force protection can pay off very well Â” in the four trading days that followed the stock climbed to escapenumber and then fell on big volume back to escapenumber following the news that the department of defense had awarded navistar a escapenumber million contract to build escapenumber escapenumber armored vehicles now the novice looks at these developments and says Â“this doesnÂ’t look good a new competitor has snuck in to force protectionÂ’s territory and the stock is down from escapenumber to escapenumber maybe i should sell now and get out before it gets worse Â” the more experienced investor says Â“itÂ’s hit escapenumber which lutts said would be an ideal entry point i think iÂ’ll put in my buy order Â” the difference you see is that the novice investor bought immediately following my recommendation while the experienced investor has been waiting to buy at the right time and the right price in four days the novice has lost some money the experienced investor hasnÂ’t but what about the news well it may mark a top for the stock but i think itÂ’s more likely an excellent example of what we like to call Â“superficial bad news Â” remember the dod may award some escapenumber billion worth of contracts for new armored vehicles and force protection has escapenumber of the market to date under the armyÂ’s mine resistant ambush protected mrap vehicle program the government will order about escapenumber escapenumber armored vehicles so this award to navistar is just escapenumber of that program thereÂ’s no doubt the army wants to spread the awards out so it can get its vehicles faster knowing that the navistar award is not unexpected but force protection still has the inside track to receive a big chunk of the orders so nothing has changed in the big picture so why is the stock down one because some traders sold on the news and two because the stock needed to come down if you simply look at a chart that is plain in fact on friday the stock nearly kissed its escapenumber day moving average which had climbed to near escapenumber before it rebounded to top escapenumber but thereÂ’s that heavy volume to consider when stocks sell off from their peaks on three times average volume it sometimes marks the end of the advance but thereÂ’s no way to know until later so how to play it if you havenÂ’t bought yet you want to wait until the correction is over the maxim for this situation is Â“donÂ’t try to catch a falling knife Â” today the stock fell to escapenumber a level that offered resistance in april and may as the days go by the picture changes and interpretation will change too and if you bought high

crew group jcg as cabot stock of the month highlighting the capabilities of ceo millard drexler the man who presided over the gap as its revenues grew from escapenumber million in escapenumber to escapenumber escapenumber billion in escapenumber excellent management remember has been one of the key ingredients in many of our best performing stocks so when we see an excellent manager in a high potential stock we pay attention j crew had reported excellent quarterly earnings in late november and the stock had soared from escapenumber to escapenumber on the results a month later when i recommended it the stock had corrected back down to escapenumber and that looked like a decent entry point in fact i wrote Â“we see no heavy selling pressures here and we believe the stock will resume its uptrend in the new year in conclusion we recommend buying here Â” well the uptrend didnÂ’t resume in the new year and in mid march jcg was still at escapenumber but we were patient the long term picture with drexler in charge was still bright and there was still no heavy selling pressure technically jcg was building a long base a formation that often serves as a launching pad for a big advance and then last week our patience was rewarded j crewÂ’s first quarter earnings results were terrific and buyers over a two day period sent the stock screaming from escapenumber to escapenumber thatÂ’s a escapenumber profit in a little over escapenumber months if youÂ’re on board hang on tight if youÂ’re not there are more attractive stocks out there with lower risk entry points

steve jobs and bill gates shared the stage at a wall street journal event and for a change they acted not as competitors but as colleagues and old colleagues at that who spent more time reminiscing about the past than discussing the present or predicting the future my favorite part of the discussion came when jobs noted that at the start of their careers in the computer industry they were often the youngest people in the room today theyÂ’re often the oldest interestingly at least to me both jobs and gates were born in escapenumber just like me in fact while jobs was born in february and gates was born in october i was born in june the month that falls exactly between the two both of them are married with three children me too but there the similarities end while both of them have changed the world in marvelous ways and continue to do so my impact has been far smaller but i have no trouble with paparazzi i donÂ’t need bodyguards and at restaurants i eat in peace itÂ’s a good life so letÂ’s talk about life for a minute or more specifically health itÂ’s been well documented in recent years that america has two big health problems one is obesity the other is the escalating cost of health care you donÂ’t need me to repeat the facts of both problems here and you donÂ’t need to be a genius to see that solving the first would help to solve the second but how to tackle americaÂ’s obesity problem i have a few ideas one begins by considering the parallels with the battle against smoking which dates interestingly back at least to the crimean war which figured in last weekÂ’s essay it seems that british soldiers returning from the war brought with them the habit of cigarette smoking and young philip morris was one of the englishmen to fill the demand by offering hand rolled cigarettes in his london store even then there was fierce debate about the health effects of tobacco but commerce and addiction won out over science and mr morris prospered yet there was always knowledge that smoking was harmful to oneÂ’s health in fact it was adolf hitler who was partially responsible for the first nationwide tobacco ban the institute for tobacco hazards research created by hitler in escapenumber banned smoking in every german university post office military hospital and nazi party office and major anti tobacco campaigns were widely broadcast by the nazis until the demise of the regime in escapenumber three decades later minnesota enacted the clean indoor air act making it the first state to ban smoking in most public spaces in escapenumber california enacted a complete smoking ban that included a controversial ban on smoking in bars and there are now escapenumber states with some form of smoking ban on the books in escapenumber the irish government implemented a ban on smoking in public places and because of these bans we are healthier so getting back to obesity banning foods that make people fat is one solution new york city banned the use of transfats in restaurants last year and many schools have chosen to reduce the availability of junk food but there are several problems with banning foods banning smoking in public places was palatable because second hand smoke hurts others so smoking could be labeled a public health hazard not so for food with food the damage is generally limited to the individual unless you get into the question of who pays for medical care and every restriction the government puts on an individualÂ’s freedom to eat as he chooses takes us one step closer to a nanny state today transfats Â– tomorrow hot fudge sundaes in general any food in small quantities is not a problem for the careful eater and i cherish my freedom to eat a hot fudge sundae on my birthday when i compare my progress to bill gatesÂ’ if i so choose with food the problem is generally one of portion size in escapenumber an order of mcdonalds french fries had escapenumber calories today it has escapenumber calories when i returned from my recent trip to china i was impressed not in a good way by the immense portions of both food and drink served at the chicago airport restaurant but how to get people to reduce portion sizes i believe a major part of the solution lies in education both on the individual level and on the societal level in general the battle against smoking has been won by educated people and though the bans have helped to achieve this i believe the greatest weapon was a growing level of consciousness among educated people that smoking was bad and so it can be for obesity but as with smoking the battle will take decades and the least educated members of society will be the hardest to reach in part this is because calories are cheap in america for this we can blame the food companies and their marketing we can even blame the government whose agricultural subsidies artificially reduce the price of grains sugar and other staples but overriding all these is the power of the individual to choose and i believe that in the long run increased societal education will help people make the right choices today seven states require body mass index bmi report cards for students and while i donÂ’t like the fact that itÂ’s required i do believe the self knowledge gained will help children and their parents begin to address the issue thereÂ’s movement afoot to require calorie information in restaurants just as we have on packaged foods and i believe that would help but i think it should be voluntary public service ads were instrumental in educating people about the dangers of smoking and so it can be with foods emphasizing the value of smaller portions and greater proportions of fruits and vegetables yes thereÂ’s great value in exercise a commodity in reduced supply in a world awash in televisions computers and video games but i believe a change in eating habits grounded in education about the health benefits of eating right is a far more powerful lever in combating obesity as for investment plays over the years weÂ’ve recommended stocks like weight watchers nutrisystem lifeway and usana when they were attractive and i have no doubt weÂ’ll recommend others in the future this is a mass market problem with the potential to bring big profits to the companies that provide a solution but today thereÂ’s nothing on our radar screen worth mentioning yours in pursuit

cast on itunes yes we made our flight back last night and the show aired from washington d c and not florida and today the current plan is that the show airs out of washington d c tonight my job is much easier when i can do the show out of washington not to mention more comfortable while i am on the topic of yesterday Â— and to give you a bit of an idea of the behind the scenes of the show Â— some woman came up to me in a florida airport with a pen and a paper and said ms cook can i have your autograph she came up fast she actually startled me since i did not see her coming and the question understandably confused me i must have looked confused because before i could say something she then said Â“arenÂ’t you ms cook Â” i said Â“noÂ” and she quickly turned and left my colleagues and i looked at each other and now wonder who ms cook is do you read the hollywood web site www tmz com i am flattered that the web site links to www gretawire com i should confess that harvey levin of tmz com is an old friend so maybe the fix was in i met harvey years ago when we both covered the o j simpson case so many of us in competing networks or media platforms have worked together or know each other from covering big stories people write about members of the media as though we are engaged in a fierce competition Â— and we are Â— but many of us are good friends when we beat each other out for interviews some have even been known to send congratulatory e mails while i would love to out those who do send those e mails of congratulations it would probably not sit well with their employers so you donÂ’t get that information if you have been watching our show the last two nights you have seen two parts of our multi part interview with author tina brown tina has written a new book about princess diana called the diana chronicles you might want to pick it up and read it i read the books of all authors before i interview them since i know that tina is a clever writer i expected to be greatly entertained by her writing style and i was what i didn't realize is how much new information i would learn from reading her book frankly prior to reading her new book i thought i knew almost everything about princess diana i had read several other princess diana books and over the years i have done many shows on princess diana and thus my thought that i knew virtually all there was to know about her well how wrong i was the diana chronicles had lots and lots and lots of new information which it made it really fascinating to read and gave me a much greater appreciation of princess diana's life as well as the life of the royals so if you are looking for a book to take to the beach and no i don't get a cut of the profits by writing about the book here i really enjoyed it now for some e mails e mail no escapenumber hi greta my thoughts on the pants judge are straightforward this judge should be punished for the recent actions he took and warned about future behavior based on what i have learned on fox he has consistently tried to take advantage of a legal system with known loopholes for his own betterment and at the expense time and money of others he has no clear and obvious sense of integrity without which he cannot command respect until his integrity returns which i assume once existed for him to have been appointed a judge he should not be allowed to preside over cases and judge others i enjoy the gretawire everyday marissa crean glastonbury ct e mail no escapenumber i am curious you spent escapenumber years getting a jd to become a tabloid journalist at cnn you were involved in political broadcasting and tonight your high moment was paris hilton i know everyone has to make a living but seems you have the talent and education to do more than this answer i actually spent five years in law school three years getting a jd and two years getting an llm are you more scandalized and here is more to shock you i enjoy these stories i sometimes find paris hilton stories a welcome relief from some of the more distressing stories we have to report plus attention gets focused on issues like alcohol and driving jail overcrowding etc this might make you feel better we are not going to stay on paris hilton stories forever e mail no escapenumber i spent one nite in jail yrs ago i was drunk no car was involved it was a shock heather santa fe nm e mail no escapenumber greta i agree with you about escapenumber percent of the time but i think you are off a little on the paris hilton thing i don't think she is a commendable person or someone to look up to i think she got what she deserved she had no respect for the criminal justice system probably still doesn't i also was not impressed with her aunts i couldn't believe they compared her coming out of jail to princess diana in the tunnel there is no comparison there keep up the good work on all the other stories i think you are the best show out there hopefully we have heard the last of this story christal marshall answer here is my thinking if she had done escapenumber days like most others i would think yes she was punished appropriately i believe she should have been punished we can't have people ignoring the law what has bothered me is that she had to do more time than most and that the city attorney seems to be above the law note i wrote seems to be since i think he is entitled to a fair hearing on the matter and evidence of criminal conduct must be proven beyond a reasonable doubt e mail no escapenumber hi greta i have long blonde hair extensions and the first thing i thought of for paris was that she can make it escapenumber days without lifting them but she will probably have to tie them back to cover the fact that they have loosed escapenumber days would have been a disaster i can understand why she had to have it taken care of before the interview tomorrow by the way i am not a child i'm escapenumber years old and still think she got a rotten deal escapenumber days in jail would have been fair since she let it get this far she had the wrong attorney in the beginning she needed to fight the original dui because the alcohol count was right on the line tell harvey she is a real person a little out there but real i think she goes to clubs to stay in the spotlight to sell her products and get acting parts he only has escapenumber on staff well those escapenumber love to delete certain peoples posts lanie carole mellas e mail no escapenumber i incensed over your commitment to so much coverage of the hilton family who has the audacity to refer to their heiress as the princess diana of the u s paris hilton does not deserve the time you've given her nor does she ever until proven otherwise deserve to be compared to the duchess of windsor especially so close to the anniversary of her death i'll be the first to admit i think the sentence s she was given was were egregious considering the crime s she committed but that is where my compassion ends deliberate perpetuation of the myth of her plight in the slammer is tantamount to worship of a useless vacuous and vapid idol please i implore you fox to cease and desist with the coverage of paris hilton i myself am embarrassed over getting upset by this issue sarah benak e mail no escapenumber greta i am very disappointed in the constant coverage of paris hilton especially the post mortem from the family on her release from jail how can any american feel sorry for her family only seeing her through glass or talking on the phone our concerns should be with the military service persons protecting our security their families can not see them through glass or talk frequently on the phone when they are overseas on foreign soil protecting us military families endure the separation for much longer than escapenumber days paris' family did not have to worry about life threatening harm at every minute paris did not have to endure exposure to harsh weather elements and hostile environments i hope you use your position in the media to help americans focus on the important values of life maybe if paris had focused on important values of life instead of party behaviors she would not have had to endure escapenumber days in a government facility our troops would probably enjoy escapenumber days home in a government facility if they could talk to and see their families of course we know they deserve much better i w huntsville al e mail no escapenumber greta i think the admin judge is an idiot and a wee bit nuts needs to have his head examined at

life and once lived just walking distance from that location the gas station where she was found is across the street from a farmers market and also dorothea dix hospital a mental hospital that facility also houses men in drug rehab there are several surrounding neighborhoods that house low income residents very very bad neighborhoods i was once in the drive thru during daylight hours of the attached fast food restaurant that is off the gas station and a man approached my car and told me to give him my wallet of course i drove off and have never went back if you drive through that area at night you should lock your doors it is no place for a young women i have escapenumber driving teenage daughters and they better never go in that area even as an adult i still lock my car doors when traveling through that location the gas station is off the main road a bit and not well lit also there is a train track right behind that gas station and that too could have been a route of entry and or exit for the perpetrator it is a very bad area in raleigh when i moved from that location escapenumber years ago it was going down hill then and has only got worse over the years i was not

very sweet girl i protected her and treated her as my own child when she lived with me she was a very organized person and she was great with my children jessie's family were also great people patty was such a strong mother that she inspired me with dealing with my children at the time whitney and audrey were only escapenumber when i knew them i am so impressed with whitney and patty's strength through this and how well whitney is being the strong leader of the family thru this this girl is only escapenumber and she composes her self so well i break down every time i hear more news on the story and i think that whitney was right when she said that this is how jessie would have been if it would have happened to one of the other girls whitney i am sure breaks down behind close doors but she holds it together so well in front of everyone and she is truly a great person my heart goes out to the davis family and how they will pick up the pieces and go on from here sarah daniels send

0,hi eben yes etoys has external formats for its documents so they can be stored on servers fetched passed around etc we have tried escapenumber different approaches over the years and all work currently one of the approaches uses the open doc standard where the scripts are in there as non standard data the format we are using now is a form of s expressions could be xml but xml is really too verbose for the xo and for slow networks and as i mentioned in the previous email when on an xo itself all the media objects could be integrated as collections of frame less x windows or some similar but simpler mechanism etoys and better an improvement in etoys that has more age range could be done in python by writing a parser for one of the file formats and making the etoys graphical environment and control in python this would completely unify these ideas on the xo but something more like the integrated architecture for many kinds of media objects would still have to be created in other words etoys per se are not nearly as important as the ideas and access to authoring power for children that they implement in any case we are gradually working on the next version of an etoys like environment that deals much more richly with more of the important issues for children's authoring than we do now cheers alan at escapenumber escapenumber pm escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber eben eliason wrote i think the biggest point to be made here is an argument for a document or object of sorts etoys definitely seems to have most of the types of interaction and media embedding solutions i believe rebecca and i both want but as far as i know though i admittedly don't know that much it does so in an all encompassing environment what we really need is a lightweight format that lets one pass around these scratchpads or collages as objects so the teacher can create a file pass it out as homework etc i could be very wrong in my assumptions though so please correct me where i am i see lots of potential for etoys and i'd like to better understand how it integrates with sugar now and how we can push it in the most effective direction eben on escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber bert freudenberg bert freudenbergs de wrote indeed scratchpad describes etoys pretty precisely you can draw write even with multi column text layout flowing around abjects and of course calculate it's not just type anywhere and a curve pops up although in fact such an extension exists but not included in the olpc etoys version called mathmorphs and morphicwrappers done by the argentinian squeak community a couple years ago http www dm uba ar mathmorphs and updated to work in recent squeak releases http wiki squeak org squeak escapenumber if there is enough interest in this and i agree it's a great environment for exploring math we might try to find someone porting it to the olpc version or maybe it just works if installed i haven't tried unfortunately our plates are still full with lower level stuff bert on jun escapenumber escapenumber at escapenumber escapenumber eben eliason wrote rebecca this sounds similar to some of my ideas for collage allowing combinations of text drawing image and other media formats in a freeform canvas the response there seemed that etoys was in many ways already providing such a thing i think this is a really interesting area though and the potential to be able to send multimedia documents around specifically in an educational environment is huge do you have more thoughts on specifically how this could be distinguished from etoys additionally there is the sophie project but i'm not that familiar with it or how far along they've come with the project on the xo eben on escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber rebecca gettys rebecca gettys comcast net wrote hello all i had an idea while playing witha green machine this may be a little late i don't know what if ther was some sort of scratchpad activity not draw or write or calculator but a kind fusion of all three mathimatical equasions could be typed out and then they could solve with typing and or drawing for their work and they could write guides and picture books and such with this activity as well is this in possible in the plans something similar is being made rebecca gettys sugar mailing list sugar lists laptop org http lists laptop org listinfo sugar

0,marcia carroll of multinational monitor yesterday joined phrma's billy tauzin's teleconference following his meeting with the thai minister of health tauzin's remarks were interesting and worth reviewing the notes that follow below are not verbatim but they are pretty close comments of billy tauzin president and ceoof phrma teleconference may escapenumber escapenumber we had a dialogue with the minister of public health of thailand it was a very frank and i think helpful discussion of the concerns that we have about the use of compulsory licenses in thailand under the trips agreement we hope to encourage more consultation and negotiation and less of this sort of confrontational resolution through the use of cls and more through negotiated agreements we impressed upon the minister our deep concern that the use of compulsory licensing sends a very negative signal concerning the investment of research dollars into critical medicines regarding diseases that all of us share and are combating it is not helpful for r d of those critical products concern that middle tier countries thailand is the escapenumberst richest country according to the world bank exercising cls has the effect of shifting the burden of r d to patients in this country patients in this country should not be required to bear an unfair burden countries should share the burden to extent of their means cl is a sort of admission of failure of negotiation and consultation it should be rare not the rule we received some assurance of this they expressed frankly the need for negotiations to be timely and to respect concerns of poverty of some citizens we acknowledged this but expressed deep reservations about cls without every compromise and negotiation thais assured us they are anxious and willing to continue negotiations with phrma companies we tried to draw a distinction between middle tier countries to help us support r d and ldcs they should share the burden rather than leave it to am citizens to carry burden alone very dangerous consequences for r d for critical medicines for critical diseases if compulsory licenses become routine our concerns are their concerns q what if thailand proceeds with other cls on non aids products would you urge the us government to file a case at the wto tauzin the us govt has obligation under section escapenumber to report on ip protection thailand can't violate patents and then protest that it shouldn't be cited for not protecting ip we got assurance from the ambassador that have a duty to respect patent rights we've urged the us government to express in strongest terms concern and if there is no change they would have to consider options including removal of preferential trade treatments in terms of future trade relations if other countries follow their example across the span of disease categories then the whole ip system would crumble and support for r d q why is thailand so important tauzin it is not just what thailand is doing brazil has sort of emulated thailand we've heard in the press that other countries are being urged to do so also there could be a spreading epidemic of disrespect for ip rights thailand is a small share of the global market but any dimunition of ip in the area sends huge important signals to investors and companies about their future plans q what do you know or learn about thai cls on cancer drugs and what's your assessment of how who dg margaret chan is handling this question tauzin i have oo info on cancer drug cls regarding margaret chan our impression of her understandings of this issue and complexities of it is that she has a very firm grip on the issue we also understand how difficult it is bottom line is that these are complex issues that will require a great deal more discussion margaret chan is entirely capable and competent in this area and we trust we will be able to work with her and who moving forward q related to thai company negoiations tauzin under am antitrust law we can't be associated with individual companies' discussions sole discretion phrma companies have a long track record of philanthropic work around world free clinics a great deal of direct assistance as they do to the poor in this country q the thai health minister is reported to have said there will be no cls if lower cost products are available from phrma companies tauzin i can't discuss actual costs we did broadly talk about our concern that developing countries like thai have some responsibility to fund the global efforts at r d the problem of how mechanically continue to assist poor in world and have countries that can afford it to support r d is something we will keep grappling with we literally acknowledged that we've seen mixed reports on those issues all we know is that a cl is an admission of failure these drugs are expensive to americans americans are not going to put up with high prices in the us and lowered prices elsewhere forever how do we who are blessed with better resources collectively share the burden and at the same time continue to sponsor and fund the enormous cost of r d i told the thai health minister that i wouldn't be alive today but for very expensive medicines developed here in america there are folks in this world who don't have access to such medicines and should have to work out some balance world those of us in devleoped and devlelping world who can collectively shoulder that burden do so q how did the minister respond to the notion that mid tier countries should bear some of the r d burden tauzin he and the delegation stressed the thai concern their poor their budget problems as you know they've dramatically increased military spending we stressed the need for balance there are conflicting numbers on whether the government is expanding coverage in thailand q what is your reaction to the thai minister being named chair of unaids and do you expect to see more expressions of concern from the congress as with the lieberman letter tauzin the appointment was one of reasons that we raised the concernt that thailand's example not be emulated around the world this is gong to be controversial for a long time whenever trying to find balance in policy deal with burden of cost sharing and extraordinary concern about access to medicines then issues are difficult look at the pdufa bill you will see a strong sense of the senate expressing real concern about abuses of cl and ip and the need for respect for r d this is not going to be easily resolved balance is never easily achieved a cl is not balance it is a failure of balance negotiations and respect for ip mutual sharing of responsibilty for cost of medicines that save lives is where need be q as you know usa for innovation has been running a series of advertisements in the us and thai press about the thai decision to issue a compulsory license first do you agree with the thrust of the usa for innovation ads and second do you know who has been funding usa for innovation so far as you know has phrma or any phrma member company or any of their affiliates funded the group tauzin those are not our ads we're not behind them i don't know who is funding them i can't comment on it i wish i could i don't know if i did i would tell you q response to bill clinton's comments contrasted with al gore supporting phrma more response to previous question if the ads agree with our position so be it i wrote president clinton a letter a week ago urging him to a sit down i met with him at the white house when he and president bush escapenumber were there for katrina relief clinton suggested we talk together regarding what we could do with his foundation i saw his last statement on thailand as an opportunity to open that dialogue our concern with his announcement was that it seemed to encourage more of what is happening in thailand and that is of deep concern to us i was pleased that al gore has expressed concern about protection of ip he has been an advocate for a long time he and i worked in the house and senate to advance satellite television we had to override president clinton's veto i know of his deep concerns for protecting innovation and invention for which this country is so famous welcome his help in resolving q would you support prize funds or methods of funding that are alternative to the existing patent based system tauzin no we believe they would be very counterproductive to investment in r d there are other good ideas about how to support innovation but ip protection has to be at the center of it even countries with strong dictatorial governments there's a recognition that free enterprise works best for their citizens if you begin dismantling the whole basis upon which people invest in r d if you break that system down you will see fewer companies and people investing in r d you should expect patients to get hurt ip health mailing list ip health lists essential org http

in each dilemma and visitors are invited to take part in the discussion the exhibition opens its doors to the public on escapenumber june there is a great deal of discussion about what is and what is not permitted in museums questions such as what should be done with art expropriated during world war ii or objects originating from an illegal excavations and should unwrapped egyptian mummies be exhibited to a large public are questions the national museum of antiquities faces regularly in collecting and exhibiting its archaeological collections in the modern and confrontational design of forbidden collections the museum offers visitors a glimpse behind the scenes based on fifteen current issues divergent viewpoints and objects from its own collections visitors can actively participate in the discussions by voicing their own opinions at an interactive table this also offers the opportunity to explore the issues in more detail the dilemmas of the exhibition are illustrated with authentic objects from the museum s own collection a bronze cuirass that the italian government claimed a few years ago to be illegally excavated and a painting from the goudstikker collection as an example of looted art are central to the theme of provenance mummies of egyptian children mummy heads and human skulls from excavations from the netherlands illustrate the issues connected to collecting and exhibiting human remains the thousands of roman oil lamps in the museum depot are on display as part of the de accessioning theme in addition a series of false and authentic etruscan bronze statuettes and heavily to minimally restored greek vases are food for thought about the authenticity of museum objects while the exhibition is on display there will be public debates in the

escapenumber from a recent post copper copse as crimes go it was not the most sensational in recent memory certainly not the most serious no shots were fired no one was killed or injured and there were no reports of threats or intimidation even though the witnesses lie mum even so the theft of four sculpted copper trees on display at spring grove cemetery arboretum was an insult visited on the entire community these trees called copper copse escapenumber were the work of local artist alicia emley who works under the name of lish there were five trees with thick copper tube trunks each with stylized willowy whips tangled branches or palm like fronds made from metal tubing they were part of spring grove's first bi annual sculpture show until somebody cut four of them off at the ground last week and hauled them away the value of art is incalculable it's measured in the joy and inspiration it brings to those who view it it may inspire provoke or entertain the thieves saw none of that probably selling them off for their worth as scrap the latest in a recent upsurge in copper thefts that have been reported in the area police alerted local scrap dealers to be on the lookout for the distinctive pieces but the trees may well have been shredded compacted or melted down by the time the report was made these thieves it's hard to imagine a single person lugging away escapenumber foot high metal trees were vandals they destroyed as well as stole clearly having no understanding or desire to understand what they were taking the sculptor told enquirer arts reporter sara pearce that while she was shocked at the audacity of a theft from a fenced gated and patrolled site she was particularly saddened for spring grove and the patrons of the show i think this situation makes a powerful statement about how public works of art deserve respect and protection spring grove is a national landmark recognized as an arboretum as well as a cemetery it also is the setting for frequent concerts tours walks and now in conjunction with summerfair an art show this theft violated that public function david wells http news enquirer com message escapenumber date fri escapenumber jun

as prague court sets precedent in restitution battles escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber by dita asiedu the prague city court has made a ruling that could set a precedent in restitution battles it has become the first court in the country to order compensation for confiscated property to come from the property's latest owner and not from the state the koh i noor factory in prague is one of the country's biggest producers of snaps pins and other metal fittings the company was founded in escapenumber by the brothers jindrich and zikmund waldes by the end of the second world war it employed some escapenumber people and was thriving only to be nationalised in october escapenumber under the benes decrees less than three years before the communists took power until the communist regime fell the factory stayed in state hands and was sold into private ownership for escapenumber million crowns at the end of escapenumber since then the heirs of the waldes brothers have been waging court battles to get back the property that was taken away from their forefathers after five unsuccessful verdicts the prague city court has now ruled in their favour half the company estate as well as escapenumber valuable paintings are to be returned to them among the paintings a painting of a woman with a press button in her left eye made by famous czech painter frantisek kupka used as a model for the company logo it is said to be the most famous czech portrait of a girl ever painted the koh i noor board of directors is outraged saying that the factory was pulled out of debt and has enjoyed massive investment in recent years the company's lawyers claim the verdict contests the constitution as with few exceptions restitution claims only pertain to property taken away by the communist regime after escapenumber general director pavel bohuminsky the court's reasoning was that even though the factory was nationalised in escapenumber the waldes family was never compensated and so the nationalisation process was not valid but the family did receive compensation it was on january escapenumberth escapenumber as part of a bilateral agreement between prague and washington that's because the waldes family lived in the united states at the time but the court did not take that into consideration so should other private owners of companies that were nationalised in escapenumber start worrying pavel bohuminsky is optimistic he says unlike the other five preceding courts the prague city court made its ruling without knowing the facts the organisation was privatised by the state under the coupon privatisation process this means that there were some escapenumber escapenumber shareholders today there are escapenumber escapenumber who could all lose their assets but what the court seems to have forgotten is that there is a specific law from escapenumber that regulates the transfer of ownership from the state to private hands after october escapenumber this law is still in place and clearly states that in a case like ours there are no rights to restitution according to mr bohuminsky the company will appeal with the supreme court if that should fail the koh i noor shareholders all escapenumber escapenumber of them will demand compensation from the czech government with the reasoning that the state had sold it stolen property in escapenumber http www radio

lawsuit to retrieve china's lost cultural treasures has been filed against a spanish american for his ancestor's having stolen two heads from the longmen grottoes in luoyang central china's henan province liu yang the lawyer who filed the case last weekend to luoyang's intermediate people's court is a member of the all china lawyers association and a senior collector of relics the lawyer told the local media that the case which was earlier rejected by several other courts will target the spanish american whose ancestor had grabbed two heads of buddhist sculptures through illegal means in the escapenumbers from longmen grottoes known as one of the four greatest grottoes in china liu says he appealed to the court to ask the american who lives in los angeles to return the chinese historical treasures when asking experts to give his treasures a proper evaluation early this year the spanish american addressed the american chinese collectors association that his ancestor was in china in the escapenumbers and abetted locals by offering only two silver dollars to help stole two heads of buddhist sculptures which were then secretly transported to the us and remained deserted in his backyard for a long time the man hoped to commission relevant organs to sell the pieces as this is the first ever lawsuit concerning reclaiming stolen cultural relics some key issues will accordingly arise liu added first for example who will be the plaintiff procuratorates cultural relics bureau an individual or state owned assets supervision and administration commission are among the possible plaintiffs according to law experts an official from the luoyang intermediate court said that an individual is not excluded as an accuser but the luoyang municipal cultural relics bureau sounds more appropriate another question is the defendant since the man's ancestor is long dead is it proper to accuse the man liu yang responded by saying that as long as the article was gained through inappropriate means it's reasonable to reclaim it from its current holder liu yang said his first thought of the idea has come from an egyptian lawyer who had taken the british museum to court in order to reclaim his country's cultural relics chinese experts have estimated that more than escapenumber million chinese cultural relics have been lost overseas according to the chinese cultural relics society most of the cultural relics were stolen and smuggled out of china rather than destroyed before the founding of the people's republic of china in escapenumber http www cctv com message

0,hey again just to let you know that i managed to test out r escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber and the transparency glitch has thankfully disappeared i apologise for wasting your time with this one final question though did you mean to say that the known transparency bug was fixed in version escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber or was it fixed in a patched version of r escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber only asking because if the final panther binary version escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber available on cran doesn't fix the bug there's no point in me installing this on top of my happily working and otherwise fully functional version of r many thanks matt on escapenumber apr escapenumber at escapenumber escapenumber matthew neilson wrote hi brian terribly sorry if i

escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber panther and the latest builds require escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber tiger or greater it's interesting to know that r version escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber contains a transparency bug though i'll ask it services to install the latest version of r on the gescapenumber and see if that helps many thanks for all your help matt on fri apr escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber prof brian ripley sent the posting guide says for questions about unexpected behavior or a possible bug you should at a minimum copy and paste the output from sessioninfo into your message if you are using an old version of r and think it does not work properly upgrade to the latest version and try that before posting there is a known bug in escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber related to semi transparency fixed in escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber i would not have attempted to answer a question about escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber and we do rely on people seeking free technical assistance doing their bit on fri escapenumber apr escapenumber matthew neilson wrote thanks for your fast response i'm using r version escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber on os x escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber to create the pdfs i have tried viewing the pdf output in both acrobat escapenumber and escapenumber both display a white border around each polygon as well as preview displays fine i have emailed the pdf file to some correspondents running windows and they also see white borders when viewing with acrobat version unspecified i have tried using r version escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber on a gescapenumber machine which i can access remotely running os x escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber but the resulting pdf renders incorrectly i e with a white border around each polygon in both acrobat and preview so it would appear that the combination of r escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber and os x escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber gives slightly better results although plots still appear incorrect when printed or viewed in acrobat unfortunately i don't have access to a windows machine to test this out even if i did many of my scripts include various unix system calls so i don't think that would be a viable solution could this be a bug in the os x pdf driver the r pdf device is the same on all platforms many thanks matt on escapenumber apr escapenumber at escapenumber escapenumber prof brian ripley wrote what version of r what os what version of acrobat i don't see this in

escapenumber apr escapenumber matthew neilson wrote hey all i'm trying to create a plot of two semi transparent regions the reason they need to be partially transparent is so that i can see if there's

funnily enough setting the alpha channel equal to escapenumber as opposed to escapenumber escapenumber doesn't give the border but an alpha channel of escapenumber produces an opaque polygon s i have read the faq and unfortunately turning off line art smoothing does not give the desired effect furthermore my pdfs print with a white border surrounding each transparent polygon now here comes the really bizarre part whilst adobe acrobat displays the unwanted white border apple preview respects the border na argument and shows the two diamonds as they are intended however opening up the pdf in illustrator cs reveals that there is in fact a transparent according to illustrator border on top of each diamond deleting these two borders one for each polygon and re saving the pdf appears to correct the issue so the obvious question is how did the surrounding borders get there in the first place a bug in the polygon function perhaps does anyone have any ideas for preventing these unwanted borders around semi transparent polygons without having to resort to illustrator has anyone else even come across this problem many thanks matt brian d ripley ripley stats ox ac uk professor of

aboard the international space stati on were disconnected from u s solar array power and ordered to restart ear ly today during a pass above russian ground stations engineers reported mi xed initial results with no eureka moment as troubleshooting continues the three redundant lanes or channels of the station's command and contr ol computer known collectively as the central computer along with all thr ee lanes of its guidance and navigation system known as the terminal compu ter were switched to russian power for the restart attempts within the last escapenumber minutes or so we have had some space to ground convers ation between the russian mission control center near moscow and space st ation commander fyodor yurchikhin along with flight engineer oleg kotov said nasa commentator pat ryan in mission control at the johnson space cent er in houston mission control called kotov at escapenumber escapenumber a m houston time to alert him that t hey were going to retry another computer restart now that they were fully d isconnected from the u s power supply commanding began at escapenumber escapenumber central ti me this morning with moscow sending the command to deactivate the power con trollers and the response was up and down there were some initial indicati ons that power was available to both the central computer and the terminal computer initially to all three lanes of both computers and then indicati ons that one or more lanes would drop off the same sort of on again off a gain responses seen earlier and it was anticipated as the trouble shooting continues it was not initially clear whether the computers were having trouble gettin g power were trying and failing to reboot or both a few minutes later ho wever ryan reported that one lane of the central computer was in fact op erating space station flight director holly ridings just receiving a report from t he houston support group at mission control in moscow summarizing the attem pted russian navigation computer restart this morning ryan reported the current situation appears to be that all three lanes of both the central c omputer and terminal computer do have power however only lane no escapenumber of th e central computer is currently working lane no escapenumber on the terminal compute r has started but then stopped has gone in and out again this is the situation that was expected as the procedures to restar t these computers are worked through that there would not be a 'eureka' mo ment when they would all start up at the same time this effort made this m orning the russians reported when they were totally disconnected from u s power the computers have not been commanded off so they are very likely continuing to try to restart themselves and the situation could change any time the computer system has been acting up ever since the atlantis astronauts a ttached a new set of solar arrays to the right side of the station's main p ower truss monday the terminal computer lanes initially crashed then dur ing a programmed reboot of both the terminal and central computer lanes th e entire system hung up the navigation system computers are required to fire russian maneuvering je ts to make major changes in the station's orientation minor adjustments ar e made with u s control moment gyroscopes but that cannot make major chan ges and the system periodically has to be reset using rocket control the s tation cannot safely operate without full orientation control to ensure its solar arrays stay face on to the sun and to prevent sensitive systems from getting too hot or too cold the problem is not serious as long as the shuttle atlantis remains docked b ecause the orbiter's thrusters can be used when needed to make adjustment s that are beyond the ability of the gyros or when the gyro system needs to be reset but the shuttle will undock and return to earth next week and th e russians have been working around the clock to get the computer glitches resolved before the orbiter departs engineers theorized that the new sescapenumber solar array or components in the circu itry delivering that power to the russian segment of the station triggered some subtle change in the lab's electrical grid the central and terminal computers built in germany by daimler benz in germany are known to be sen sitive to noisy power late thursday outgoing station flier sunita williams her replacement clay anderson and kotov used a signal analyzer to characterize the power flowin g from the u s to the russian segment after that data was shared with the ground the system was physically disconnected to make sure no ground path could be causing problems even with power shut down the space station will make repeated passes over russian ground stations th is morning and additional troubleshooting efforts are expected the atlantis astronauts are scheduled to wake up at escapenumber escapenumber a m while the rus sians are pressing ahead with computer troubleshooting

0,hiya while i was finally able to get my dectalk express to work properly and provide hardware synthesis for speakup i've noticed that alsa seems to enjoy being a real pain to configure on debian for some reason when i've booted i've noticed that dev mixer among other things isn't being created i would think that udev could do that not to mention dev dsp and all is there something fairly simple i'm missing thanks zack speakup mailing list speakup braille uwo ca http speech braille uwo ca mailman listinfo speakup

0,on escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber paul smith wrote on escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber ravi varadhan wrote my point is that it might be better to try multiple feasible starting values for constroptim to ensure that you have a good local minimum since it appears that constroptim converges to a boundary solution where the gradient is non zero that is why my code could be useful thanks ravi i have used your function which works pretty fine however constroptim returns solutions markedly different depending on the starting values that is true that i am expecting a solution in the boundary but should not constroptim find boundary solutions correctly the set of solution that i got is below unless there are many local optimal solutions paul escapenumber escapenumbere

help on escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber ravi varadhan wrote here is another approach i wrote an r function that would generate interior points as starting values for constroptim this might work better than the lp approach since the lp approach gives you a starting value that is on the boundary of the feasible region i e a vertex of the polyhedron whereas this new approach gives you points on the interior you can generate as many points as you wish but the approach is brute force and is very inefficient it takes on the order of a escapenumber tries to find one feasible point thanks again ravi actually the lp approach also works here let g x k be the constraints then by solving a lp problem with the constraints g x k escapenumber escapenumber returns an interior starting value for constroptim i am aware that the new set of constraints may correspond to an impossible linear system but it works in many cases paul original message from paul smith date tuesday july escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber pm subject re r fine tunning rgenoud to r help on escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber ravi varadhan wrote it should be easy enough to check that your solution is valid i e a local minimum first check to see if the solution satisfies all the constraints secondly check to see if it is an interior point i e none of the constraints become equality and finally if the solution is an interior point check to see whether the gradient there is close to zero note that if the solution is one of the vertices of the polyhedron then the gradient may not be zero i am having bad luck all constraints are satisfied but the solution given by constroptim is not interior the gradient is not equal to zero paul original message from r help bounces stat math ethz ch on

you had indicated in your previous email that you are having trouble finding a feasible starting value for constroptim so you basically need to solve a system of linear inequalities to obtain a starting point have you considered using linear programming either simplex in the boot package or solvelp in linprog would work it seems to me that you could use any linear objective function in solvelp to obtain a feasible starting point this is not the most efficient solution but it might be worth a try i am aware of other methods for generating n tuples that satisfy linear inequality constraints but afaik those are not available in r thanks ravi i had already conceived the solution that you suggest actually using lpsolve i am able to get a solution for my problem with constroptim

0,mark overmeer writes jonathan scott duff duff pobox com escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber you mention oop for perl escapenumber we have a standard if very general syntax and open semantics that have allowed people to implement oop in a variety of ways this was all well and good for a while until we realized that there should be some more reasonable defaults in both syntax and semantics for common operations in oop oop in perlescapenumber has a mechanism but not a standard in the use of those features full oo languages all choose a direction but there are serious culture differences perl uses them all there are many ways how to instantiate an object which is lot of fun as programmer but a hassle for the average programmer within one program you may very well need to use different instantiation techniques of course this could have been forseen perl is not the first language which implements oo and some advice on the convention to use could have avoided wild collection of approaches we see now but if this had been forseen and restrictions put in place then we wouldn't have had the recent advances in things like inside out objects and mop the flexibility and people doing different things allowed for experimentation and where those experiments were successful new ideas gained community mindshare very quickly this is also why perl best practices is a good book shameless plug indeed but it doesn't need to be part of the perl core although i would have welcomed it escapenumber years earlier but it extols many practices which weren't thought of escapenumber years previously hence the need for flexibility so as to allow time to invent them i think it's the same thing with podescapenumber it's open enough that many documentation systems can be built from it man pages books magazines wikis etc for some of those documentation systems we'll have nice conventions and other conventions will grow as needed if we find that convention isn't enough in specific areas without any doubt there are thousands of documentation systems around at least ten percent of them are considered the best ever made by its developer or developer community just by simple math the chance that the system developed really is the best is less than one percent quite so which is why in my previous mail i thought it was shortsighted to think we can create something now which we won't later want to change imo any argument that podescapenumber is good because it can be used to write books or express complex mathematical expressions is really frightning me pod as in the version with perl escapenumber wasnt designed for writing books or whatever yet people liked it enough they took it in directions that nobody first expected there's a good chance of that happening with pod escapenumber even if it isn't an aim every single complication added to the doc syntax will make it not to understand for a large percentage of the primar target community as every teacher can tell you from experience you could say the same thing about perl escapenumber or even earlier versions yet we cope partly by ensuring that you don't need to learn all of it in order to be able to use it in the case of pod one of the things that helps is its large overlap with plain text when i create a program it starts with a goal to reach that goal i have to write some code some docs some tests for me it is all part of the program i do not see one to be of more importance than the other all three are first class sitizens in my program testing is another area which has had immense progress since the release of perl escapenumber look at where test more test class tap parser and so on are now we certainly wouldn't want to be restricted to a standard of best practices in testing from the early escapenumbers smylers

a bunch of linux boxes after that you need to install and configure a cluster filesystem and mount that cluster filesystem on all the linux boxes that will form your cluster we have primarily used the gpfs filesystem for our testing but any cluster filesystem should work as long as it provides correct file locking other cluster filesystems while we primarily test with gpfs ctdb should work with almost any other cluster filesystem as well please let us know your experiences in using other cluster filesystems modified file 'server ctdb recoverd c' a server ctdb recoverd c escapenumber

0,hi there your problem here is that perl is kind enough to see the whole scalar as one line so what you would have to do is break it up in several linse shove them in an array then do a foreach on the array to split and drop it in the hash like so my array split \\n test foreach my line array chomp line my fname fvalu split line print fname fvalu\\n this will do the trick the chomp is not realyea needed by the way as i am sure someone will be pointing out in the near future and i'm ptretty sure you could make this into a one liner which would be faster but for readability this is the simplest way of doing it regards rob on escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber goksie wrote hello can someone help me correct this code if i print it only print the first line goksie usr bin perl use strict my test 'nas ip address escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber quintum nas port escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber escapelong nas port type async user name escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber called station id escapenumber calling station id acct status type stop acct delay time escapenumber acct input octets escapenumber acct output octets escapenumber acct session id escapelong acct session time escapenumber acct input packets escapenumber acct output packets escapenumber service type login user quintum avpair hescapenumber ivr out accesscode escapenumber quintum hescapenumber conf id escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber quintum avpair hescapenumber incoming conf id escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber quintum hescapenumber gw id ng la quintum hescapenumber call origin answer quintum hescapenumber call type voip quintum hescapenumber setup time escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber utc sun apr escapenumber escapenumber quintum hescapenumber connect time escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber utc sun apr escapenumber escapenumber quintum hescapenumber disconnect time escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber utc sun apr escapenumber escapenumber quintum hescapenumber remote address escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber quintum hescapenumber disconnect cause escapenumberf quintum hescapenumber voice quality escapenumber quintum trunkid in escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber quintum trunkid out escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber hescapenumber incoming conf id escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber client ip address escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber acct unique session id escapelong timestamp escapenumber' my test my fname fvalu split test foreach keys test print test output nas ip address escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber quintum nas port to unsubscribe e mail beginners unsubscribe perl org for additional commands e mail beginners help perl org http learn perl org

0,this is on a bit of a tangent from this discussion but in case you don't already know about it a canadian filmmaker brett gaylor has put the process of making a documentary film on a collaborative website open source cinema he encourages people to upload raw footage remix it and edit the script of the documentary allowing the community to contribute to the argument it makes http www opensourcecinema org manifesto i don't know what brett uses to run his site but it might be suitable for what you're looking for it sounds like his project would benefit from a repository like the one you're describing cheers andy asheesh laroia wrote i know that jon philips was interested in doing something similar with particular focus on footage that documents the free culture movement he made a page on the freeculture org wiki about his idea http wiki freeculture org spread free culture freeculture org is the student arm of the free culture movement for those who don't know it i've been very busy lately and dropped the ball on helping him which i'm a little sad about i wanted to take this time to make sure people have had a chance to look at his idea as written on our wiki and discuss any appropriate sharing of work on the software end as i understand things jon was probably going to use cchost asheesh andy kaplan myrth ll b m a manager law technology university of ottawa faculty of law facultÃ© de droit university of ottawa universitÃ© d'ottawa escapenumber louis pasteur street ottawa on kescapenumbern escapelong canada t escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber xescapenumber f escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber e techlaw uottawa ca w http www commonlaw uottawa ca tech cc community mailing list cc community lists ibiblio org http lists ibiblio org mailman listinfo cc community

0,featuring lutts' logic france vs china entrepreneurship chinese style making money from world of warcraft it's time for a little more coverage of china why because that's where the action is those chinese stocks just won't quit and neither will my brain which is still weighing the sights and sounds i experienced on my recent trip there with other experiences and occasionally coming up with surprising comparisons for example my daughter who is now studying in china as a college junior spent her freshman year studying at the american university of paris among the first orders of business once she arrived in paris was acquiring a mobile phone and to do this she needed to have a local bank account so she walked into a bank one day and asked to open an account the response come back tomorrow we're too busy to me it was a perfect illustration of the french attitude that the job of the worker is more important than the needs of the customer i don't believe this could happen in america though as time goes on i know it becomes more possible but i know with absolute certainty that it wouldn't happen in china a few weeks back in fact i wrote about the issue of excess human capital in china a reality that provides a willing worker often two or three for any task that needs to be done more recently my daughter wrote in a similar vein and i think you'll find her comments interesting the chinese people are the most overwhelmingly enthusiastic entrepreneurs i've ever seen their eagerness to seize every opportunity to sell things is obvious besides fruit street vendors have everything from dvds to beer from nail clippers to hot sweet potatoes from bicycle seat covers to new soles for your shoes and that's just in the back alley behind my school their determination to sell you stuff translates into huge benefits for the customer not only does it mean low prices great variety and convenience the service is also incomparable i went to buy a laptop with my friend amanda on monday and it was unlike any experience you'd have in the states we started out browsing on the ground floor of one of the electronics malls in zhongguancun where the salespeople swarming the floor shout compliment and sometimes even grab to get your attention focused on their product once we'd expressed interest they all kept trying to convince us to come to their stores on the upper floors explaining that the ground floor was closing in ten minutes it turned out to be true and amanda found a couple laptops she liked so we allowed three of the salespeople to escort us to the escapenumberth floor which they did in extremely courteous fashion their store on the escapenumberth floor was packed with helpful salespeople computers and large blue couches we sat on a couch and they gave us paper cups of water then brought over several laptops and set them on the coffee table in front of us to try out the manager of the store who spoke english sat down on the couch across from us and explained the features of each computer and told us the prices which he could lower a bit just for us of course after amanda chose a laptop small light and an inexpensive chinese brand one of the salespeople installed windows microsoft office and an internal wireless card for her right there at the table then he gave her a free computer bag to carry it away in and we were escorted out of the building by another salesperson a girl who was very impressed by our pale skin amanda's curly red hair and my height who carried the computer out for us the overall feeling is that you're doing them a favor by buying the computer from them which given that there are at least four buildings in zhongguancun filled with people selling laptops you kind of are the origins of this entrepreneurial spirit are complicated and i won't pretend to be an expert yet but i think a lot of it comes from the newness of this type of opportunity as recently as the escapenumbers there was no private property in china all businesses were state owned we're only at the mid escapenumbers in my history class right now but i have studied the economic reforms some in sociology and some in chinese in which our current lesson is called self employed cucumber seller and money chasing not kidding although tight control was and is maintained the reforms allowed private business and private property and gave the chinese people a whole new range of choices the chinese word for entering the private sector we just learned in our cucumber seller lesson literally translates into jumping into the sea it's a big deal in a country where state owned enterprises composed the entirety of the economy less than a lifetime ago the money chasing part of the lesson describes entrepreneurs who will sacrifice everything to earn money including abandoning ethical business practices the point is even by the standards of non communist countries the marketplace in china is huge thriving flexible and growing and of course it's not all because of the entrepreneurial spirit there's the population the reinforcing effects of raising the standard of living the growing middle class and probably some cultural influences too what it means for me is i can buy everything i need within a escapenumber minute walk from my dorm and it's cheap too note this intelligent young woman of course i'm biased who's majoring in journalism and international relations is available for summer employment opportunities in the boston area back in salem which in pre clipper ship days boasted america's greatest china trade my current view of china is centered on the charts of the chinese stocks that climb up my computer monitor and i've got to tell you they're strong i thought we'd have some kind of pause in the chinese market particularly after cabot china emerging markets report was ranked the escapenumber advisory letter in the business based on its escapenumber return last year after you're escapenumber there's no place to go but down but i was wrong while we had a quick escapenumber plunge in the shanghai index a few weeks ago just enough to shake out the weak holders chinese stocks have roared back and are hitting new highs again how to explain it fast growth continues and the world's money continues to pour into china at the most basic level demand exceeds supply there simply aren't enough chinese stocks to go around editor paul goodwin works hard to keep an eye on every one of them and he tells me there are about escapenumber chinese stocks that trade in the form of adrs on american exchanges when i look at the list i see a lot of strong stocks but i also see something else some very big holes for example there is no major chinese retailer where we have dozens from gap to target to federated stores they have none there is no national restaurant chain where we have mcdonalds wendy's krispy kreme and starbucks they have none there are no national food processors we have dean foods kraft con agra tyson and smithfield they have none and medical investments forget it no hospital chains no assisted living chains no biotechnology stocks just a few traditional medicine sellers medical device manufacturers and one western style clinic public stock exchanges no online brokers no insurance companies just one you get the picture in time these sectors will develop and as they do there will more places for all this foreign capital to go until then it goes where it can and it pushes stocks up advertisement how does cabot pick emerging markets stocks paul goodwin editor of cabot china emerging markets report looks for promising companies benefiting from the rapid growth in the economies of the bric countries brazil russia india and china they must also meet strict criteria regarding fundamentals and technicals these recommendations will have healthy balance sheets and will show solid growth visit the below link to see the explosive profits from the fast growing opportunities paul recommends see how escapenumber escapenumber can soar to escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber or more over the next two to three years rated escapenumber top performing newsletter for escapenumber by the hulbert financial digest http cabotmail net t escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber my favorite investment sector in both the u s and china is the solar power photovoltaic sector it's not for the faint of heart what goes up can come down fast too but most companies in the industry are enjoying triple digit growth of revenues their manufacturing costs are falling as they grow volumes and develop more efficient methods and their profit margins are fat we've suggested several solar investments in recent issues of the advisory and you don't need any more so today i want to share with you my favorite non solar chinese investment the stock first appeared in the pages of cabot china emerging markets report but i wrote it up as stock of the month in early march and what i wrote then still applies today here it is let's get one thing clear here we're not talking about gambling we're talking about playing about games in the original sense but this isn't kid stuff the online game industry has grown up and absorbs billions of dollars from gamers all over the world the most exciting action right now is taking place in china for reasons that are not hard to understand gdp is growing about escapenumber per year but of escapenumber escapenumber billion people only escapenumber million have internet access and just three quarters of those have broadband connection a necessity for playing most of today's modern games so there's a vast untapped market but the industry is growing fast last year the number of online players increased escapenumber to escapenumber million and their spending on these games increased a whopping escapenumber to escapenumber million theescapenumber limited is our favorite of the top tier game providers in china mainly because it's the fastest growing the name admittedly awkward refers to the claim that game is the ninth art after the traditional eight namely painting sculpture architecture literature music dance drama and movies but the real name to remember here is world of warcraft because that's the game that accounts for escapenumber of theescapenumber's revenues world of warcraft hereafter know as wow was launched by an american company blizzard entertainment in november escapenumber and currently serves more than escapenumber million players worldwide two million of these players are in north america escapenumber escapenumber million are in europe and escapenumber escapenumber million are in china and every one of those chinese players is a customer of theescapenumber which holds the exclusive chinese license what's so great about this game in a phrase the fact that it's easy to begin but impossible to finish despite the title it's more than a war game it's more of a quest game in which you via your onscreen character strive to complete quests in the early levels these quests are easy to complete alone but as you gain in experience and the quests become more complex cooperation with other players in real time becomes necessary so alliances are built up experience builds assets gold weapons clothing accumulate are used and are accumulated again or are bought and sold from other players just as in the real world and the amazing thing is that the vast majority of these other players who are cooperating in real time on screen have never met in real life the shorthand for games like this is mmorpg for massively multiplayer online role playing game but on the screen they form a society and it's a big one in china the maximum number of payers online at one time in the fourth quarter was escapenumber escapenumber while the average number of players online at any time is escapenumber escapenumber and it's beautiful society visually in an epic way there are mountains oceans forests towns and cities pets beasts and monsters good guys and bad guys and the virtual world is ever evolving on january escapenumber for example fireworks went off at midnight on february escapenumber it happened again to celebrate the lunar festival chinese new year and sometimes you've got to buy more software to keep up back on january escapenumber for example the dark portal in blasted lands opened and demons poured out but this content was only available to purchasers of the burning crusade expansion pack in the u s you can buy wow on amazon for escapenumber and the expansion pack for escapenumber in china prices are lower but the real money is in the monthly fees in the u s it costs about fifty cents per day to play the game in china it's about six cents per day and that's gravy for theescapenumber in the fourth quarter revenues grew escapenumber from the year before to escapenumber escapenumber million while earnings jumped escapenumber to escapenumber escapenumber per share equally important profit margins swelled to a fat escapenumber escapenumber so what's in the future more wow of course the end of this game's life is nowhere in sight nevertheless the company is bringing out a slew of new games that will broaden its revenue stream these include guild wars and soul of the ultimate nation which have been developed in house and three games that have been licensed from their makers ragnarok online escapenumber and emil chronicle online two cartoon style mmorpgs and huxley a highly rated mmorp first person shooter game looking further down the road there's the inevitable advent of the gaming consoles today you see all gaming in china is done on computers dedicated gaming machines like the microsoft xbox escapenumber sony playstation escapenumber and nintendo wii are not allowed but when they are analysts say microsoft has already partnered with theescapenumber you can bet theescapenumber will be there to serve the online market the stock broke out to new price and rp peaks just last month and ran up to escapenumber before pulling back into a consolidation phase as we write it's pulled back to below escapenumber to kiss its uptrending escapenumber day moving average and we think this presents a decent entry point today that buy looks pretty good the stock has climbed back to escapenumber and found decent support there in part because of a published report that u s giant electronic arts would pay escapenumber million for a escapenumber stake in ncty electronics arts denied this but it's no secret the companies are working closely on getting electronic arts' games distributed the chinese market and the action of the stock confirms that belief i

0,hi all i renamed the subject to clean out the reference i have no idea why kfreebsd was mentioned in the original email if the debian desktop packages are going to reorganized for lenny then it would suit to make a list of the debian desktop package goals first so far there is a general wish for splitting the packages by purpose i agree with this and think it would make maintaining the packages simpler however it will be very important to limit the dependencies to prevent complex dependency chains from happening here are some ideas on the packages that could be used this is derived from emails on the list and anything that comes to mind at escapenumberam edt desktop base this package is responsible for providing base infrastructure and configuration mechanisms used by the debian desktop package suite to that effect i feel that we should define and maintain the file system structure for any shared elements in this package in effect this makes desktop base the central package for directing and defining desktop package policy and conformance all debian desktop packages should depend on this package in order to help maintain consistency desktop artwork this would clearly be a package that provides desktop artwork for themes and other forms of visual improvements this isn't just for the eye candy people this is equally important for visually impaired users or users that need other forms of custom visual requirements initially i am considering themes and artwork for the visually impaired but it might be feasible to support screen readers and other accessibility features however that might be better suited for a package like desktop accessibility or similar desktop scripts this would provide a collection of scripts the user may optionally use for situations like auto mounting local drives and partitions it might also be good to include default scripts for creating basic backups and other useful tasks that people need each script would need to be disabled by default and enabled using debconf to support preseeding i think adding the prefix debian to these package name is a good idea although the debian prefix may seem unnecessary it makes creating things like ubuntu desktop base and distrox desktop base escapenumber much simpler not that i want this to happen but it can't be prevented so why not prepare for it now ideally the desktop base package specification could be used to apply default branding and configuration for a derivative distribution using the alternative distrox desktop base package this brings to mind the possibility of using alternatives for this sort of thing as well but that seems overreaching at this stage this idea could definitely use conflicts to prevent multiple copies of the desktop base to be installed imagine being able to change the branding using a simple apt get install distrox desktop base distrox desktop art so if you agree with me assume that those package names get the prefix this is point well worth discussion beyond just the desktop base package name i don't think a desktop configuration package is needed since we can apply the configuration to the appropriate desktop related package this is the approach i have in mind for desktop scripts above additionally trying to place all the configuration in a single package can create config file issues if not handled carefully i don't think splitting desktop art into gnome kde xfce versions is necessary or even a good idea it will make it more difficult to synchronize the art and c\\would require duplicate copies of the art used then again i might have missed something on this point now the big bugaboo localization the current packages don't support localization and don't really need them now however if we start setting up common scripts and provide desktop interfaces to them with something like say zenity or kdialog then it stands to reason that we will also need these to be localized in the future it also makes sense to provide a localization solution for the distrox issue mentioned above i dunno maybe this is also a bit overreaching at this stage as well ok that's enough from this lurker thanks matthew p mcguire ps sorry for the top posting i needed to organize my thoughts fully escapenumber oh no he's been using brand x the joker batman escapenumber to unsubscribe email to debian desktop request lists debian org with a subject of unsubscribe trouble contact listmaster lists debian org

0,i think some of the limitations you describe speakup having is due to the design being entirely kernel based i think jupiter is part kernel and part user space based may be its time for some more advanced features to be added to speakup via some scripts or something similar so we would have all the features speakup offers now at anytime and more advanced features when the system is fully loaded from michael whapples on sun escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber at escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber cleverson wrote hi all it would be nice to have an interface such as speechd up for the jupiter screen reader see www eklhad net linux jupiter index html speakup apears to miss interesting features or perhaps its documentation is not complete for example it's not able to make the entire shell session available for reviewing and i become restricted to the escapenumber lines limit of the current screen also there's no way to program macros so that specific keys could read different parts of the screen as well as custom settings for different apps there seems to be a command to read a text continuously insert r however it doesn't work fine here it reads the first two lines of text and then stops reading whether someone knows any solution for these problems concerning speakup or perhaps an alternate console screen reader that works with softsynth in particular espeak i'll be grateful to know cheers cleverson be realistic ask for the impossible speakup mailing list speakup braille uwo ca http speech braille uwo ca mailman listinfo speakup

escapenumberd escapenumberd escapenumberd escapenumberd escapenumberd escapenumberd escapenumberd samba escapenumber is the ambitious next version of the samba suite that is being developed in parallel to the stable escapenumber escapenumber series the main emphasis in this branch is support for the active directory logon protocols used by windows escapenumber and above while we welcome your interest in samba escapenumber we don't want you to run your network with it quite yet please note the warnings below and the status file which aims to document what should and should not work with over escapenumber years of development under our belt since tridge first proposed a new virtual file system vfs layer for sambaescapenumber a project which eventually lead to our active directory efforts we felt that we should create something we could 'show off' to our users this is a technology preview tp aimed at allowing you our users managers and developers to see how we have progressed and to invite your feedback and support escapenumberd escapenumberd escapenumberd escapenumberd escapenumberd escapenumberd escapenumberd escapenumberd warnings escapenumberd escapenumberd escapenumberd escapenumberd escapenumberd escapenumberd escapenumberd escapenumberd sambaescapenumber tp is currently a pre alpha technology that is more a reference to sambaescapenumber's lack of the features we expect you will need than a statement of code quality but clearly it hasn't seen a broad deployment yet if you were to upgrade sambaescapenumber or indeed windows to sambaescapenumber you would find many things work but that other key features you may have relied on simply are not there yet for example while samba escapenumber escapenumber is an excellent member of a active directory domain sambaescapenumber is happier as a domain controller this is where we have done most of the research and development while sambaescapenumber is subjected to an awesome battery of tests on an automated basis and we have found sambaescapenumber to be very stable in it's behaviour we have to recommend against upgrading production servers from samba escapenumber to samba escapenumber at this stage if you are upgrading an experimental server or looking to develop and test samba you should backup all configuration and data as we research the needs of active directory integration more closely we may need to change the format of the user database but until we make an alpha release we won't do any upgrades this automatically indeed many module changes are simply easier to cope with if you just re provision after the upgrade we value the security of your computers and so we must warn you that samba escapenumber technology preview includes basic access control list acl protection on the main user database but due to time constraints none on the registry at this stage we also do not currently have acls on the swat web based management tool this means that samba escapenumber technology preview is not secure and should not be exposed to untrusted networks within the above proviso file system access should occur as the logged in user much as sambaescapenumber does as such we must strongly recommend against using sambaescapenumber in a production environment at this stage escapenumberd escapenumberd escapenumberd escapenumberd escapenumberd escapenumberd escapenumberd changes escapenumberd escapenumberd escapenumberd escapenumberd escapenumberd escapenumberd escapenumberd 'sambaescapenumber tpescapenumber' presents you with a snapshot into sambaescapenumber's ongoing development as we move towards our first alpha releases this technology preview tp is a snapshot of sambaescapenumber's development as at june escapenumber in the time since tpescapenumber was released in january escapenumber samba has continued to evolve but you may particularly notice these areas work has continued on swat the the libnet api behind it these we hope will grow into a full web based management solution for both local and remote samba and windows servers the drsuapi research effort has largely concluded and an initial implementation of ad replication is present included in torture test cases this includes the decryption of the ad passwords which were specially and separately encrypted this should be recognised as vital milestone likewise the ldap backend project has moved from a research implementation into something that can be easily deployed outside the test infrastructure testing has been an area of great work with renewed vigour to increase our test coverage over the past few months in doing so we now demonstrate pkinit and many other aspects of kerberos as well as command line authentication handling in our testsuite the testsuite infrastructure has been rewritten in perl and extended to setup multiple environments allowing testing of the domain member as well as the domain controller roles sambaescapenumber's initial implementation of winbind has been revived to fill in these tests in clustering work on ctdb an implementation of a clustered samba has moved ahead very well but the current code has not been merged into sambaescapenumber in time for this release to support better management we have investigated group policy support and include the infrastructure required unfortunately without mmc write support you will need to place the polices into the directory by hand as we move forward we have many of the features we feel are required for a sambaescapenumber alpha similarly we know enough about the data formats particularly those that are encrypted to be confident that we won't need to change the ldb format our plan is to publish a sambaescapenumber alpha in the next few months these are just some of the highlights of the work

war spending bill that calls for the withdrawal of american combat troops from iraq the white house said the president has said he will veto the measure dan bartlett a counselor to the president said mister bush has asked the three broadcast networks for air time itÂ’s four years after president bush landed on an aircraft carrier in the pacific ocean and declared major combat in iraq was done Â– under a banner that said Â“mission accomplished Â” today president bush said a u s failure in the escapenumber year old war should be unacceptable to the civilized world the white house marked the anniversary by accusing congressional democrats of using the date to present the president with the bill speaking to u s and allied military officers at u s central command headquarters outside tampa mister bush said the current push to pacify baghdad and the western province of anbar has produced progress but will need several months to succeed coalition forces have captured a number of key terrorist leaders who are providing information about how al qaeda operates in iraq he said they stopped a car bomb network that had killed many citizens of baghdad and destroyed major car bomb factories there has been a decline in sectarian violence an d in some areas of the capital iraqis are returning to their neighborhoods with an increased feeling of security shadowy iraq office accused of sectarian agenda iraq's prime minister has created an entity within his government that u s and iraqi military officials say is being used as a smokescreen to hide an extreme shiite agenda that is worsening the country's sectarian divide the office of the commander in chief has the power to overrule other government ministries according to u s military and intelligence sources those sources say the escapenumber member office is abusing its power increasingly overriding decisions made by the iraqi ministries of defense and interior and potentially undermining the entire u s effort in iraq the office as it is known in baghdad was set up about four months ago with the knowledge of american forces in iraq its goal is ostensibly to advise prime minister nuri al maliki the nation's new commander in chief on military matters according to a u s intelligence source the office is ensuring the emplacement of commanders it favors and can control regardless of what the ministries want ali dabbagh spokesman for the iraqi government would not respond directly to questions about what authority the office exercises within the iraqi government he denied allegations that the prime minister's advisers were trying to push a shiite agenda however a senior iraqi army officer disagreed the officer who is seeking help from the senior u s command said the office is not supposed to be taking charge like this it's overstepping its role as an advisory office it's not a healthy thing to have it's people with no power who want to have power a senior u s military official cited several cases in baghdad in which iraqi commanders considered capable by the u s were detained or forced out of their positions after cracking down on shiite militias a white house official confirmed that the u s government does have specific concerns about the office adding we are working with them on their command and control issues to make sure it works properly and so that commanders are put into their jobs for the right reasons and not just sectarian reasons yesterday white house press secretary tony snow said the administration was concerned about stories that the iraqi government was trying to execute the bagh dad security plan along sectarian lines rage in the streets demonstrators call for change in immigration laws from los angeles to new york demonstrators descended on city centers around the country to call for congress to pass legislation that would give the estimated escapenumber million people in the united states illegally a path to citizenship in chicago where a police spokeswoman estimated the crowd at escapenumber escapenumber early in the afternoon organizers predicted a total of hundreds of thousands of demonstrators would participate in a two mile march to union park where estimates of last year's attendance ranged from escapenumber escapenumber to escapenumber escapenumber organizers of this year's events are focusing on raids by immigration officials that have separated some of the nation's illegal immigrants from their children who are u s citizens if born in the united states department of homeland security secretary michael chertoff tells cnn we do have to remember it's the parents' choice to break the law at the end of the day we cannot compromise on enforcing the law simply because somebody has given birth to a child in the united states children who are born in the united states are not deported he said although we recognize that in almost all cases the child will accompany the parent back but he added that he too believes that congress which is slated to consider the matter beginning may escapenumber must pass legislation we are going to need to find a way that is reasonable and fair and not an amnesty to deal with the undocumented workers who are here he said house panel approves subpoena for former deputy attorney general by a voice vote today a house judiciary subcommittee approved the issuing of a subpoena to former deputy attorney general james comey to testify as part of its investigation into the firing of the eight u s attorneys the panel chairwoman congresswoman linda sanchez democrat of california said comey has informed the committee he will comply and appear at a hearing of the commercial and administrative law subcommittee set for thursday we believe that he can shed light on the bush administration's list of targeted u s attorneys sanchez said comey announced his resignation in april escapenumber but served for several months afterwards until a replacement was named through documents released and testimony given to congress justice department officials have said the process for choosing which prosecutors would be asked to leave began in january escapenumber paul mcnulty who replaced comey was one of the officials involved in later discussions about the firings he told sta ff from the senate and house judiciary committees during an all day closed door interview friday he only had limited involvement in the process a congressional aide familiar with the interview confirmed to cnn mcnulty became the latest official to say he was not responsible for putting the names on the list of those to be fired the congressional aide said previously attorney general alberto gonzales and former justice department chief of staff kyle sampson have testified they did not add names of specific prosecutors one major question those leading the capitol hill investigations into the firings have said they are trying to answer is exactly how that list was drawn up fidel castro a

0,on sat jun escapenumber escapenumber at escapenumber escapenumber escapenumberpm escapenumber don armstrong wrote choice of venue clauses can short circuit the normal determination of jurisdiction in civil cases in some jurisdictions in some cases contracts and licenses in general short circuit the normal determination of rights under common or legislated law in some jurisdictions in some cases too since this is giving up a right normally enjoyed in exchange for the ability to use or modify a work it appears be a fee and as such fails dfsg escapenumber you're not giving up any rights you're gaining the right to modify and distribute the software under certain conditions just as you are under the gpl there's no fee involved any more than there is under the gpl's requirement to release your modifications under the gpl or to provide source when you distribute binaries you're required to give up something you might value and otherwise demand compensation for certainly but there needs to be something more than that to violate the dfsg it's possible that there's actually something bad about choice of venue but analogising it to a fee just makes the discussion completely opaque to anyone who's not interested in theoretical dfsg analysis if the dfsg doesn't have a clause that covers why it's bad we can change the dfsg but if we don't have a good simple explanation why it's bad for actual free software users and developers there's no need to be claiming it's non free the dfsg are a set of guidelines if you can't explain violations in simple understandable terms they're not violations equally just because something doesn't directly and clearly contradict some specific text in the dfsg it may still be a real violation and if you really want to have licenses determined by how people feel rather than analysing the effects of the license in real world situations as compared to what's actually written in the dfsg i expect you'll find we just end up with more grs like the the gfdl gr that doesn't match commonly held opinions on debian legal at all i'm personally using feel as shorthand for my understanding of the legal situtation regarding this clause and its relation to the dfsg that's great but your understanding isn't any more important than anyone else's nor is francesco's nor is bernhard's there's something fundamentally wrong with the way discussions work on debian legal that people think that simply posting their understanding is a valuable contribution the reason why it's not is that it doesn't provide any good way of resolving disagreements you can either revert to authority such as ftpmaster's you can resort to polls such as a gr or an informal one on forums debian net or you can attack people who hold different opinions in the hopes that they'll stop speaking and thus not be heard in future i'm well aware that i'm personally more concerned about licensing matters than the average developer but then again that's also why i perhaps na vely expect people who disagree with my analysis to actually engage the analysis with counter arguments come to a complete understanding of the problem and then make a determination and implying that other people aren't sufficiently concerned about licensing matters aren't actually engag ing the analysis with counter arguments don't have a complete understanding of the problem in order to stop them mak ing a determination sounds like a pretty good match for the last case ultimately debian's policy isn't going to be decided by whoever understands legal issues the best it's going to be decided by the developers who contribute to debian whether they fully understand things or not trying to limit the discussion to experts is all very well but it'll just leave non experts ignoring the discussions when they end up making the ultimate decision my goal is to convince ftpmasters and developers that my analysis is reasonable and that these works with licenses containing these kinds of clauses have no place in main failing that i can only educate users and if the project doesn't adopt your views then promoting them to users as though they're an official consensus isn't educat ing users it's misleading them that shouldn't stop you from promoting your opinion as your opinion but honesty demands that you at least make it clear where official policy ends and your opinion begins fwiw i don't think ftpmaster's opinion is final discussion on legal is nice but ultimately irrelevant is a satisfactory way of deciding official policy on this but while discussion on debian legal of views such as non dds opinions aren't official debian policy the gfdl without invariant sections is a free license choice of venue doesn't stop a license eg the mpl or cddl from being a free license the dissident test doesn't need to be passed by all dfsg free licenses rfcs don't need to be free is more or less unwelcome or at the very least seen as unwelcome by people who hold those views i don't see any way of improving things in particular whoever ends up responsible for debian's official policy will need to spend their time educating users on what the official policy actually is not their opinion on what the official policy should have been to take a particular example if you want to retain the privelege to call the gfdl vote result wrong you're excluding yourself from being in a position to define debian's interpretation of free software and it doesn't matter what the outcome of that vote had been including if it had been the gfdl is a free license even with invariant section for reference ftpmaster's votes on the gfdl resolution were option escapenumber gfdl licensed works are unsuitable for main in all cases option escapenumber gfdl licensed works without unmodifiable

engineers c ontinue blanket assessment escapenumber the atlantis astronauts late today used the shuttle's robot arm and a power ful camera on the end of a heat shield inspection boom to take a close up l ook at a pulled up insulation blanket on one of the ship's aft rocket pods the astronauts noticed the protruding blanket on the left side orbital mane uvering system rocket pod during a routine post launch inspection late frid ay john shannon chairman of nasa's mission management team said late tod ay there's not a great deal of concern over it right now but there's a lo t of work to be done and we'll do that in the coming days a preliminary assessment of ground video and imagery from atlantis indicate s the ship's repaired external fuel tank performed well during the climb to space with only minor instances of foam shedding and nothing apparent abo ve nasa's critical threshold for causing damage to the shuttle's heat shiel d as you remember there was a lot of concern pre flight when we had the hai l storm in february and it put well over escapenumber escapenumber divots in the upper part of the tank shannon told reporters the crew was able to image that very we ll after the orbiter separated from the tank the external tank team is loo king at that very closely but from what we can tell so far we did not los e any of the repairs everything looked exactly like it should look it loo ks like everything stayed in place the only obvious bit of foam loss occurred near a escapenumber inch wide liquid oxyge n feed line near the top of the tank's hydrogen section we saw a little escapenumber inch by escapenumber inch divot by that big feed line that takes ox ygen to the main engines shannon said that is very similar to foam loss es we've seen in previous flights we expect that it will give us some data on the mechanics of why the foam comes off in that area and we can work on improvements in future tanks this is not any kind of a threat to the vehi cle at all it's just good engineering data analysis of data from c band and ku band radars near the launch pad is on g oing as is an assessment of data from impact sensors mounted behind the rei nforced carbon carbon panels making up the leading edges of atlantis' wings camera mounted in the shuttle's twin booster rockets will be recovered an d assessed after the spent casings are towed back to port canaveral on sund ay shannon said those camera may have captured the moment the foam separated f rom near the feedline and they may show whether a paper rocket nozzle cover or any other sort of debris hit the protruding insulation blanket on the l eft oms pod the blanket was installed in january and engineers think it mo re likely that a corner simply pulled away in the airflow video from the space shuttle's robot arm early today showed a escapenumber inch by escapenumber i nch triangular section of the blanket separated from where it butted up aga inst a section of white heat shield tiles close up pictures later today pr ovided a clearer image showing the escapenumber inch thick blanket intact but folded back in one corner there's an area on the oms pod that is protected by tile it has more ae rodynamic forces on it a little bit more heating then that transitions in a lower heating area to the blankets and at that transition point it look s like one corner of one of those thick blankets pulled up a little bit s hannon said it looks like some of the stitching ripped and a corner of th at peeled up engineers are assessing the blanket to determine what if anything might n eed to be done on the first shuttle flight in escapenumber several tiles on each of columbia's oms pods were cracked or missing but no problems were seen a fter landing likewise a blanket lost during another early shuttle flight caused no problems but in the post columbia world nasa takes no chances and shannon said the protruding blanket seen on atlantis' port oms pod will get a thorough engin eering analysis to make sure it doesn't pose a threat to the ship or its cr ew we have flight history of damage to these oms pods shannon said early in the program sts escapenumber we lost some tile material sts escapenumber we lost at least one blanket in that area and for all of those we do not believe we had an y damage at all to the oms pods even so he said we're going to go and characterize it and go through our analysis every flight i feel like i'm a broken record i come in and say 'there's this thing it doesn't look like a big deal we're going go do ou r assessment and see how it turns out ' we'll do the exact same thing on th is flight the atlantis astronauts already plan to carry out three spacewalks monday wednesday and friday to connect and activate a new space station solar ar ray retract another solar panel so it can be moved later and perform a var iety of other assembly tasks shannon said if necessary the astronauts could work on the protruding blan ket possibly tucking the material back in and pinning it down or even usin g a viscous heat resistant tile repair material to fill in the exposed und erlying area but nothing like that will be planned until engineers complete their assess ment of the damage and the likely effects of re entry aerodynamics and heat ing on surrounding blankets and the underlying structure of the rocket pod the atlantis astronauts meanwhile

said today he was thrilled at the prospect of enjoying a few moments of weightlessness during an airp lane ride off florida's east coast attended by a team of physicians nurses and supporters hawking expected t o experience escapenumber to escapenumber seconds of weightlessness each time the zero gravity corp 's boeing escapenumber jet crested the top of a parabolic arc passengers in su ch flights

subjected to about escapenumber escapenumber times the normal force of gravity hawking who suffers from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis or als lou gehrigs disease will be closely monitored throughout the afternoon flight many people have asked me why i am taking this flight the renowned physi cist told reporters earlier today at the kennedy space center's shuttle lan ding facility i am doing it for many reasons first of all i believe tha t life on earth is at an ever increasing risk of being wiped out by a disas ter such as sudden global warming nuclear war a genetically engineered v irus or other dangers i think the human race has no future if it doesn't go into space i theref ore want to encourage public interest in space he said speaking through a computer in his famously robotic voice i have long wanted to go into space and the zero gravity flight is a first step toward space travel i al so want to demonstrate to the public that everyone can participate in this type of weightless experience peter diamandidis founder and ceo of zero gravity corp said the flight w as organized to benefit four charities easter seals the starlight starbr ight children's foundation augie's quest

diamandis said the entire team is pumped and read y to go to fulfill his dream of being weightless to ensure's hawking's safety the physicist will be closely monitored by hi s personal team of physicians and nurses during a test flight wednesday us ing an eighth grade student as a stand in the team perfected the way they will gently lower hawking to the padded floor after each parabola to make s ure he remains comfortable during the half minute or so when he will be sub jected to escapenumber escapenumber times the normal force of gravity we've done a tremendous amount to ensure safety on this flight diamandis said we feel we have an excellent safety plan diamandis said hawking's doctors will assess blood pressure oxygen levels and other factors after the first parabola to make sure it is safe to proce ed diamandis said he would be happy with a single parabola prompting hawk ing to interject a computer synthesized no as you can imagine i am very excited hawking said earlier i have been wheelchair bound for almost four decades and the chance to float free in z ero g will be wonderful hawking is considered one of the world's leading authorities on quantum bla ck holes and

0,http tinyurl com escapelong from thehill com contributed by ian swanson may escapenumber escapenumber drug companies are making a concerted effort to increase pressure on thailand and other developing countries to honor u s drug patents the pharmaceutical research and manufacturers association phrma is alarmed by thailand's decision to authorize the production of generic versions of two aids drugs that are still under u s company patents as well as one cardiovascular drug in particular u s drug makers worry that other countries could emulate thailand's decision brazil earlier this month announced it will authorize a license for the production of an aids drugs phrma notes phrma president and chief executive officer bill tauzin said that in the long term this move could cost u s jobs and cause the entire system of protecting intellectual property to crumble if other countries also issue compulsory licenses for the production of generic drugs particularly emerging markets like thailand tauzin said u s consumers would be forced to carry a greater burden of covering the industry's research and development costs world trade organization wto rules do grant poor countries the right to issue compulsory licenses authorizing the production of generic drugs to deal with public health crises but critics feel thailand is pushing the envelope by announcing a license for plavix a cardiovascular disease medication tauzin met with thailand health minister mongkol na songkhla on tuesday to discuss the issuance of the three compulsory licenses in a follow up call to reporters tauzin emphasized that his talks with the thai minister were frank and helpful and that mongkol emphasized that his country sees the issuance of compulsory licenses as a rare event thailand officials have also suggested they may issue a compulsory license for a cancer drug but tauzin said mongkol offered nothing new during the meeting on that subject tauzin said mongkol's message to phrma was that many of thailand's citizens are mired in poverty and that the country has a need for access to cheap medicines tauzin said phrma's hope is that thailand will fully consult with u s companies to lower drug costs without resorting to authorizing the production of generic drugs at the same time tauzin said that if thailand continues to issue compulsory licenses for the production of drugs protected by patents phrma could press the administration for tougher action he specifically mentioned the possibility that the u s could eliminate trade preferences allowing some thai imports to enter the country duty free indeed the office of the u s trade representative late last month issued an annual u s report on the status of intellectual property protections that faulted thailand for deteriorating patent protections the special escapenumber report elevated thailand to a list of priority watch countries which could lead to a decision to withdraw trade preferences but it is unclear whether washington will want to punish poor countries that issue compulsory licenses to increase their supplies of affordable drugs particularly with democrats in charge of congress and phrma's influence on the wane thailand's actions have received support from some key advocates including former president bill clinton whose clinton foundation has worked with drug companies to lower prices for medicines in developing countries the reuters news service this week quoted clinton as stating that no company will live or die because of high price premiums for aids drugs in middle income countries but patients may rep henry waxman d calif in a statement released after his meeting with the health minister said the u s should respect thailand's decision but some in the pharmaceutical industry believe members of congress will draw a distinction between drugs for the treatment of aids malaria and tuberculosis and those for other diseases such as cancer or heart disease how can a chronic slow acting non contagious condition be considered a public health crisis asked one lobbyist he suggested there could be bipartisan support for actions against thailand or other countries that issue compulsory licenses for non aids drugs in march five democratic senators and escapenumber democratic house members raised the issue in letters to u s trade representative susan schwab they said the use of wto rules to produce generic aids drugs is one thing but the rules were not intended to be used on just any medicine while thailand has argued the issuance of compulsory licenses was necessary to pay for drugs through its national health care system tauzin said the country's government run by the military after a coup last year has increased military spending while arguing it cannot afford to pay for patented drugs tauzin said the debate will always be controversial because finding the balance between access to medicines and paying for research and development costs is always difficult at the same time he expressed some confidence that phrma's arguments would have support ip health mailing list ip health lists essential org http lists essential org mailman listinfo

0,hi we are having some problems on a workstation where we run a gina replacement and do escapenumber escapenumberx authentication on user logon this means that the network is not available when nobody is logged in the computer after the network becomes available we try to log the user into the domain and we get a unknown user name or bad password error if we wait for one minute the logon works ok we did a series of packet captures and found out that during that time some kind of initialization with the domain is done which normally is done when computer boots we'd like to know if it is possible to reproduce this behaviour using the windows api in order not to have to wait for a minute after each logon can anyone give us a tip on where to look thanks in advance carolina bruzzoni

promoting pharmaceutical innovation the world health organization who last week made public member governments' written comments on the development of a global strategy and plan of action for research and development on diseases that disproportionately affect poor countries differences persist even though countries are scheduled to wrap up their discussions in the autumn to date nineteen countries and regional groups have submitted their views on the initial draft texts drawn up in december escapenumber by the intergovernmental working group igwg on public health innovation and intellectual property see bridges weekly escapenumber december escapenumber created by who members in escapenumber the new working group is mandated to draw up a medium term framework to support sustainable needs driven essential medical research and development r d in accordance with the findings of the global health body's commission on intellectual property rights innovation and public health cipih some see the group's deliberations as an opportunity to explore alternatives to drug patents as a means of encouraging innovation and the development of new and affordable drugs the working draft of the igwg's plan of action has attracted a wide range of recommendations on topics including the strengthening of innovative capacity transfer of technology management of intellectual property and financing mechanisms the sharpest division between governments relates to the who's role in dealing with international intellectual property rules particularly the wto agreement on trade related aspects of intellectual property rights trips especially controversial was whether the action plan should deal with promoting the use of legal flexibilities in the trips agreement which make it easier to bring generic drugs to market and are widely considered to be crucial to the affordability of medicines brazil suggested that many ip related matters deserve increased attention such as the full implementation of trips flexibilities ensuring the immediate entry of generic medicines into markets following patent expiry and improving the patent approval process it suggested mapping out the various flexibilities provided for in international agreements that might be relevant to ensure access to medicines malaysia called for a re evaluation of the current ip system with emphasis on ensuring that public health needs are not adversely affected by strong intellectual property rights at the same time several developed countries argued that the trips agreement and ip rules in bilateral trade agreements fell outside the mandate of the who the us indicated that the igwg should not consider several specific issues present in the current draft action plan including topics such as legal flexibilities in the trips bilateral trade agreements compulsory licensing and provisions encouraging generic entry upon patent expiry it said that they were more appropriate to the scope and mandate of the wto and the world intellectual property organization wipo australia said that it cannot accept any binding proposal that bilateral agreements not contain 'trips plus' provisions which entail ip obligations beyond those required by the trips agreement further it endorsed a proposal for cooperation with wipo the wto and other international bodies taking into account their mandates other controversial issues included alternative financing mechanisms for promoting pharmaceutical innovation one such proposal seeks a global treaty that would have governments fund medical r d and then make the findings public allowing drugs thus produced to be manufactured and sold cheaply since there would be no research costs to offset another mechanism envisions the collective management of intellectual property rights through patent pools a third model would be based on 'prize funds' and would give innovators monetary awards tied to improvements in healthcare outcomes bangladesh proposed that the igwg consider the prize fund model noting that its separation of incentives for innovation from drug prices would ensure low prices for medical inventions the country also backed calls for giving the proposed r d treaty formal consideration in contrast the us submission stated that it does not support any new funding mechanisms japan recommended use of existing mechanisms to promote r d efficiently a submission from iran suggested that innovative new health related products should be shared between developed and developing countries in order to counteract the brain drain caused by developing country scientists who emigrate and contribute to the development of innovation in industrialised countries a paper from the us on the other hand held that developing countries should strengthen their own human resources and address the migration of health professionals in a manner that respects the freedom of individuals to emigrate and build a better life for themselves and their families one underlying theme in the submissions was the need for more information and best practices about innovation promotion the eu wants more background information on the elements of the action plan and raised questions about impediments at the national and international level to investment in r d as well as options for improving policy coherence thailand called for the compilation of good practice and lessons on the implementation of trips flexibilities noting that experience sharing would be very useful for cross fertilization among developing countries the us suggested that the who collaborate with wipo to compile and disseminate best practices to improve health related innovation ellen 't hoen of mÃ©decins sans frontiÃ¨res told bridges that the igwg process had thus far focused on procedures and lacked discussion on substance now member states were debating concrete proposals spring gombe and thiru balasubramaniam of knowledge ecology international praised countries including bangladesh bolivia iran norway india thailand and east timor for showing great leadership in recognising the need for examining new methods of stimulating research and development pledging their support for the prize system as a method for rewarding r d in lieu of high drug prices they also expressed hope that the african countries which had played a leading role at the inception of the igwg process would make new submissions in light of the issue's importance to them the secretariat will incorporate countries' comments on the current draft text into a revised version by july the igwg is scheduled to meet for its final session in november escapenumber in principle the final plan of action should be ready for adoption at the may escapenumber session of the world health assembly the who's top decision making body bangladesh and bolivia have expressed concern that there is simply not enough time for the igwg to complete its work by then and

0,dear list http www teachingcommons ca is only one small example of how creative commons could and should enter schools as it comes to education and the transfer of knowledge from generation to generation the importance of free and thus mobile resources becomes very obvious i wonder if there is any larger communities of teachers dealing with work sheets and teaching material under free cc alike licence apart from wiki books possibly host for free school books http creativecommons org education points to quite few sites as for germany my home country there are several community pages sharing educational stuff but mostly under pending unknown licenses possibly a new set of licences could make sense for schools in order to make governmental and official institutions use them of course it is better to keep the amount of different licences low to ease share alike handling but maybe you have an idea for an attractive lable to tag educational stuff with suggestions educative commons teaching commons free knowledge public heritage regards ralf p s thinking about it an extension of the by tag could make sense claiming the naming of the parent version and of its first anchestor like this derived from based on the work this makes it easier to keep track of great amounts of variations of a work sheet which might make sense in math exams for instance cc community mailing list cc community lists ibiblio org http lists ibiblio org mailman listinfo cc community

0,hi i'm looking to test if two distance matrices are statistically different from each others these two matrices have been computed on the same set of data several population samples escapenumber using a particular genetic distance escapenumber weighting that genetic distance with an extra factor we can look at this as one set is computed before applying a treatment and the second one after applying that particular treatment kind of a similar situation both these matrices are obviously not independent from each others so mantel test and others correlation tests do not apply here i thought of testing the order of values between these matrices if distances are ordered the same way for both matrices we have very similar matrices and the additional factor has quite no effect on the calculation is there any package or function in r allowing to do that and statistically test it with permutations or another approach i did check the mailing lists but did not find anything on that problem i'm trying to solve thanks for your help and insights on that problem stÃ©phane buhler r help stat math ethz ch mailing list https stat ethz ch mailman listinfo r help please do read the posting guide http www r project org posting guide html and provide commented minimal self contained reproducible code
